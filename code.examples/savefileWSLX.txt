WSL X-windows 
-------------
The Run function detects the IP address of the windows
host, then sets up DISPLAY variable and enables LIBGL acceleration,
before starting the following applications:

   xterm
   lxterminal
   nautilus

Does not work?
--------------
If it does not work, check that X server has access
control disabled!!
