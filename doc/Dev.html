<h1>CFT Change log</h1>


<h3>4.4.3 2025-03-20 global name space</h3>
<p>
Moved syn(), eval(), getType() and currentTimeMillis() from ObjGlobal into ObjSys, to minimize pollution of global name space
</p>
 

<h3>4.4.2 2025-02-03 CFT.props include</h3>
<p>
Added a line #include private/CFT.props, and implemented support in Java, in order to 
override settings in a way that is not replaced on git pull.
</p>

<h3>4.4.1 2025-01-30 SSH script</h3>
<p>
Fixed so that executing sudo on remote host also works both with and without password. Added
detection for both ssh and sudo, turning passwords for ssh and sudo on and off per host.
</p>
<p>
Both passwords are stored as session encrypted data.
</p>

<h3>4.4.0 2025-01-29 SSH script</h3>
<p>
Rewrote parts of the SSH script, so that it handles both password and passwordless ssh.
</p>

<h3>4.3.5 2025-01-28 Hosts script</h3>
<p>
Rewrote the Hosts script, parsing the hosts configuration file for remote management of hosts via ssh.
</p>


<h3>4.3.4 2024-12-30 Convolution Matrix (Std.Raster)</h3>
<p>
Added support for applying a convolution matrix kernel to a Raster image, for line detection etc
</p>


<h3>4.3.3 2024-11-30 Raster object</h3>
<p>
Added Std.Raster object for creating pixel images
</p>


<h3>4.3.2 2024-10-03 File.read() TAB control</h3>
<p>
Added parameter deTab which defaults to true, replacing TAB with 4 spaces, as this
is how File.read() was always implemented, but needed to disable this conversion when
reading and writing files that will in turn be diffed by GIT. 
</p>
<p>
Also added script AutoEdit, which in turn is called from Maven:VersionEditPom function, 
which allows us to replace the version of building as well as depending on resources by
groupId alone, or groupId + artifactId.
</p>

<h3>4.3.1 2024-09-24 history commands with "!"</h3>
<p>
Improved the history command handling, and included the directory history into it. Deleted shortcut @H from CFT.props
<pre>
!?

Command history
---------------

  !            show full history
  !?           help (this text)
  !!           repeat last command

  !N           execute command by position in history
  !xxx         repeat last command starting with xxx
  !xxx*yyy     repeat last command starting with xxx and containing yyy

  !:N          as above, but changes to original directory
  !:xxx
  !:xxx*yyy

  !/           show unique list of directories from history
  !/N          go to directory by position in list

</pre>


<h3>4.3.0 2024-09-21 history commands with "!"</h3>
<pre>
Type "!?" for help:

	"!" displays the command history
	"!!" repeats last command
	"!xxx" repeats last command starting with xxx

</pre>
<p>
Keeping shortcut @H for directory history 
</p>

<h3>4.2.5 2024-08-27 output from external commands</h3>
<p>
Created Dir.runCaptureShow and intended using this in BangParser, which runs external programs, but doesn't quite work.
</p>

<h3>4.2.4 2024-08-26 Sys.lastResultList</h3>
<p>
Remembering last result that was a list separate from Sys.lastResult, which behaves as before.
</p>

<p>
Rewritten :N in expressions to fetch data from Sys.lastResultList, as it is a problem when typing
something involving :N and doing something wrong, that we have to recreate the list, possibly
using several steps.
</p>

<p>
Created shortcut @: to show the last result list, simply calling Sys.lastResultList
</p>

<p>
Also gave the interactive grep an overhaul. 
</p>



<h3>4.2.3 2024-08-20 interactive grep</h3>
<p>
Extended the interactive (shell-like) grep implementation, to accept a mix of files and
expressions (inside ()'s).
</p>

<h3>4.2.2 2024-08-15 Util:ShowDict</h3>
<p>
Added Lib:ShowRows to format a list of Row objects for sending to file or printing
on screen (as in Util:ShowDict with parameter show=true). Extended Row object as needed.
</p>


<h3>4.2.1 2024-08-14 XML</h3>
<p>
Improved the XML parser, using it to parse maven pom files, see Maven script.
</p>


<h3>4.2.1 2024-07-19 All tests ok</h3>
<p>
The report() cleanup fixed the notorious Tests01:Test13* which have been unresolved
since 2021. 
</p>
<p>
These concerned
Inner block report() output propagation. Since out() was correct, and
report() now is a glorified out(), doing essentially out(Sys.Row(...)), this issue went away, and now
all tests run OK.
</p>

<h3>4.2.1 2024-07-19 moved Row to Sys.Row</h3>
<p>
Don't want to pollute global name space with such a generic name
</p>


<h3>4.2.0 2024-07-15 Stdio / Jobs</h3>
<p>
Changed output via Stdio/StdioReal/StdioVirtual to support both
print() and println(). Had to modify handling of Jobs. The aim
is full control via the Curses script, and extending the Prompt
script to keep track of background jobs etc.
</p>
<p>
This means it gets possible to extend the Prompt script to draw
output from background jobs, if the terminal is big enough.
</p>

<p>
Implemented before report() but merged after ...
</p>


<h3>4.1.0 2024-07-18 report()</h3>
<p>
Changed report() so that it adds a normal out() value being an instance of new
object type Row. This in turn has an implementation of getContentDescription() which
returns columns for all values that are of the following types:
</p>
<pre>
static final String reportTypes = "String|FileLine|int|float|boolean|null|Date";
</pre>
<p>
Other values are not included, but the Row objects have a get() function.
</p>
<pre>
Example:

Dir.files->f report(f, f.name, f.length)
/test

# Running this we get a report, but we can then say

:N.get(0) - returns the file
:N.get(1) - returns file name
:N.get(2) - returns file length

:N.get    - with no parameter, defaults to .get(0)
</pre>
<p>
This means we can use all data created by report()
</p>


<h3>4.0.16 2024-07-05 updating file headers</h3>
<p>
Java and script
</p>


<h3>4.0.15 2024-06</h3>
<p>
Have done various additions to the font stuff, extending script Letters7x5 to also
contain 18x10 and 9x10 fonts.
</p>
<p>
Added the ^ mathematical operations (pow).
</p>

<h3>4.0.15 2024-04-21 - Std.DD</h3>
<p>
Added optional Std.DD.World parameter when creating Std.DD.Ref, so that we can pass the 
single Ref object around when building models. Also created DDLib script, which handles
common shapes, and also printing text, using the (rather primitive) Letters7x5 font.
</p>

<h3>4.0.14 2024-02-17 - Dict bug</h3>
<pre>
Dict.set("keys",1).keys returned 1, but should return list of keys: [ "keys" ]

Fixed in DottedCall.java, so that dotted lookup of value only ok when no Function of
that same name.

Can even say 

d=Dict d.keys=1 d.keys   

# runs the keys function

# To get the value 1:

d.get("keys")

</pre>
<p>
Also removed a dead function from ObjDict
</p>


<h3>4.0.13 2024-01-05 - Dir.filesCount() and Dir.allFilesCount()</h3>
<p>
Plus mod of @S (Lib:SearchTextFiles which calls DoSearchTextFiles)
</p>

<h3>4.0.12 2023-12-10 - Bitwise operations</h3>
<p>
Added bitwiseAnd, bitwiseOr, bitwiseNot, shiftLeft and shiftRight to int.
</p>
<p>
Also modified String.parseInt so it strips out underscores from the number
string.
</p>


<h3>4.0.11 2023-12-04 - Sys.Rest.Apache</h3>
<p>
The default Sys.Rest implementation gives no JSON on error, but using Apache libraries
we get error data back in certain cases. The Apache implementation does not support
file upload, and is limited to GET and POST.
</p>

<h3>4.0.10 2023-11-27 - Sys.Rest</h3>
<p>
Added functions auth() for generalized authorization, like bearer tokens. 
</p>
<p>
Added function multipartFile() for uploading file data.
</p>
<p>
Currently can not combine jsonData and multipartFile(s), and multipartFile(s) also require
method to be POST.
</p>

<h3>4.0.9 2023-11-20 - String.left and .right</h3>
<p>
Member functions for aligning left/right and padding with spaces
</p>

<h3>4.0.8 2023-11-10 - @c @v</h3>
<p>
Changed @c to copy both files and directories into clipboard, and @v to use Sys.stdin to create
a cp command. Removed @x and added @clip to see clipboard content and @cliprm to delete files
that are referenced in clipboard.
</p>

<h3>4.0.8 2023-11-03 - Vault:GetPersistentSecret</h3>
<p>
For storing secrets over time. The password is stored as a session secret, to minimize interactivity.
</p>

<h3>4.0.8 2023-11-03 - Sys.Rest</h3>
<p>
Java implementation for doing REST, since CURL errors are wildly off on windows, and for completeness.
</p>

<h3>4.0.7 2023-06-14 - Working on the Lexer</h3>
<p>
The XML parser now WORKS, and handles CDATA.
</p>


<h3>4.0.7 2023-06-13 - Working on the Lexer</h3>
<p>
The XML parser simply does not work, and certainly can not handle
CDATA. Experimenting with the Lexer, and initiated the Tests05 script
to both test and document its operation, as it is quite complex.
</p>

<p>
Also changed the "force internal command" prefix from the cumbersome '$'
to the much simpler SPACE. This is necessary when testing code, as the
auto-switch to assuming its an external command follows when internal code
fails with certain conditions. 
<p>

</p>
See previous point, on trying to express CFT failures that should not
result in trying input as external command.
</p>



<h3>4.0.6 2023-05-12 - Exceptions hierarchy + shell changes</h3>
<p>
Tried creating a cleaner custom exception hierarchy, for safer detection of CFT runtime errors that
should NOT result in trying to run the command as an external program. Not quite ready.
</p>
<p>
Also added a line modifier to FORCE input to be run ONLY as CFT code, in order to see error
messages, using the '$' character. So now we have the following cases for input:
</p>
<pre>
xyz       # fails in CFT, tries to run as external command, shows PowerShell error message
$xyz      # fails in CFT, shows CFT exception!
&lt;TAB&gt;xyz  # forces input to run as external program only!

# Defineed here:

ShellCommandsManager.FORCE_CFT_CODE_PREFIX = "$"
ShellCommandsManager.FORCE_EXTERNAL_COMMAND_PREFIX = "\t"

See Root.processInteractiveInput()
</pre>	


<h3>4.0.5 2023-03-28 - _Shell function improvements</h3>
<p>
Modified global _Shell function (which lists shell functionality)
</p>

<h3>4.0.4 2023-02-24 - Shell commands mod</h3>
<p>
Changed the "force external command" character from old "!" to new "<TAB>", to free up
the "!" for future history functions (as in bash).
</p>


<h3>4.0.3 2023-02-23 - CIFS improvements</h3>
<p>
Added CIFSFile.getUrl and renamed script CIFSExample to just CIFS, and improved it with 
a function to show content of a remote directory.
</p>


<h3>4.0.2 2023-02-21 - bug fix / synthesize</h3>
<p>
After rewriting synthesize, FileLine, Int, Float and Str resulted in stack overflow when
synthesizing, as they called super.synthesize(), which in turn called the createCode() function,
resulting in endless callstack. Changed super.synthesize() to super.createCode().
</p>
<p>
Also fixed bug in Util:CURL where verbose=true changed return value to List, due to
forgetting to run a couple of loops inside Inner (when verbose).
</p>


<h3>4.0.1 2023-02-03 - not a sub-language but ...</h3>
<p>
Created a parser for table data in columns, using HERE document format.
</p>

<p>
Written in CFT only, but complex enough to warrant a version number.
</p>

<p>
See TableParser script.
</p>




<div style="border:2px solid orange; padding:1Em; width:60Em">

<h2 class="tag">4.0.0 2023-02-02</h2>
<p>
And <i>there</i>, it just felt like version four, with interactive OS commands integrated into CFT without
special syntax.
</p>
<p>
Looking through the list of what has been done since 3.0.0 and roughly comparing
to the work between v2 and v3, it is clear that it is time for version 4. 
</p>
<p>
Even as the 3.8.3 change of running OS commands is a bit hack-like, it works well. May at some point
decide to formalize the detection of where errors come from, to differentiate between an input line
meant for the OS, and an input line with bad but attempted CFT syntax.
</p>

<h4>So ... will there be a version 5??</h4>

<p>
My private TODO list has shrunk quite a bit lately. Some of the remaining (big) ideas follow.
</p>

<h4>Pluggable functionality</h4> 
<p>
Formalizing an interface or a way of adding pluggable functionality,
using CFT as control script for external and specialized processes that do not naturally fall into
the CFT code tree.
</p>
<p>
Have even considered writing terminal games ...
</p>

<h4>I/O and terminal handling</h4>
<p>
Another advanced issue is improved I/O and terminal handling, so that we can create some rule set for 
automatic submitting commands not only to a regular external program, but also to ssh,
so that CFT can login automatically with username + password over ssh, if needed. This is a
big "can of worms" compared to the simplistic one-line-at-a-time I/O model, which has
worked very well so far.
</p>

<h4>Avoid blocking or hanging commands</h4>
<p>
One application of the above would be a long-dreamed solution to the problem of how both CFT code and
in particular external commands sometimes will take way too long, even hanging. The idea here is that
all commands issued at the command line are run in a separate process, and the REPL remains
attached to the most recent, interacting with it normally, until we press Esc or something, at
which point we disconnect, leaving it running in the background, and returns us to prompt. 
</p>

<h4>Sub-languages</h4>
<p>
The original plans, before deciding on functions, was that every (or some) objects could support their own
mini language, parsed separately, perhaps only depending on respecting the use of curly braces. One such
language could be multiline OS native scripts, corresponding to how we use OS commands directly from
the interactive command line ...
</p>

<pre>
	Std.Ext {
		cd (WorkDir)
        mvn clean package
        cp target/*packages*.jar (TargetDir)
	}
</pre>
      
<h4>OS commands inline in code</h4>
<p>
Could also let the "bang" notation be supported inline in CFT code.
</p>  
<pre>
	WorkDir.cd
	!mvn clean package
	!cp target/*packages*.jar (TargetDir)
</pre>


<h4>Networking</h4>
<p>
A long-time concept has been that of letting instances of CFT communicate with each other, so that
they could form a network, allowing us to manage hosts only available indirectly, via jump hosts,
from the local PC. This would also really require running CFT as services, but the main reason it has
never surfaced for real, are the security concerns. I mean, bypassing ssh or windows logins? Not likely
to be accepted in any real world environments. 
</p>

<p>
I did a test on invoking CFT commands remotely in a separate CFT process some time during 2021. It worked, 
but had no real use by itself, and was deleted from the code base. The java class StdioVirtual is a remnant
from this test, which later has seen use for managing I/O for background jobs and processes.
</p>

</div>

<h3>3.8.3 2023-02-01 - run OS commands without bang</h3>
<p>
Implemented a hackish solution to the annoying bang ("!") needed to prefix
external commands, in Root.java, doing some exception message string comparison, but
it seems to work. 
</p>
<p>
For names of external programs that overlap with internal commands, either
in the script or the CFT shell, we can still use "!" as prefix to force
running the external program.
</p>
<p>
Implemented by prefixing the input line with a bang if certain conditions met,
and attempting running it through the ShellCommand code, after failing to
run as regular CFT.
</p>
<p>
This is an mportant feature, but the code is shaky still, so not v3.9
material just yet.
</p>
<p>
Also modified the "." syntax (repeat last command) so that "." + File.separator
is attempted run as a a bang command.
</p>
<p>
Updated docs.
</p>


<h3>3.8.2 2023-01-24 - shell path lookup syntax</h3>
<p>
Added "Path lookup" syntax, where if a shell argument starts with "-", then
the following term is used to match path of current directory, entering a
complete of partial name of parent directory.
</p>
<pre>
cd /some/long/path/down/a/deep/tree
cd -down/different/path
pwd
/some/long/path/down/different/path
</pre>

<p>
Works with all the shell functions
</p>

<pre>
cd /some/long/path/again
touch -pa/test.txt
</pre>

<p>
Here 'pa' matches 'path' and we touch file /home/long/path/test.txt
</p>


<h3>3.8.1 2023-01-21 - shell command TAB == '*'</h3>
<p>
Being used to autocomplete with TAB in shell, when detecting a shell command, we replace TAB with '*'
</p>


<h2 class="tag">3.8.0 2023-01-18</h2>
<p>
Completed restructring the docs, as well as the shell improvements now tested.
</p>


<h3>3.7.8b 2023-01-15 - refactoring shell commands</h3>
<p>
Restructuring the code for processing Shell commands, including automatic
generation of content for global _Shell command and simpler maintenance
in ShellCommandManager.
</p>


<h3>3.7.8 2023-01-15 - refactoring: IsSynthesizable</h3>
<p>
Made interface IsSynthesizable, to easier manage which objects are synthesizable or not.
</p>



<h3>3.7.7 2023-01-14 - :N is now expression</h3>
<p>
Implemented :N as general expression for Sys.lastResult(N).
</p>
<p>
Also supports :: to mean Sys.lastResult (without position)
</p>
<p>
This simplified the ShellCommand.java parsing, as :N is no longer a special case.
</p>


<h3>3.7.6c 2023-01-13 - shell command hash and hex</h3>
<p>
Fixed so that these use Sys.LastResult if missing args
</p>
<p>
Adjusted the Prompt script, to use environment to get host name
if not set, plus sensible defaults for colors, etc.
</p>
<p>
Improved the 'diff' shell command for windows powershell.
</p>
<p>
Added 'which' command to shell
</p>


<h3>3.7.6b 2023-01-12 - 'continue'</h3>
<p>
Added statement "continue", which corresponds to "assert(false)" or "reject(true)"
</p>
<p>
Added test for it, and updated doc.
</p>


<h3>3.7.6 2023-01-07 - 'pwd'</h3>
<p>
Moved pwd from Expr to Shell.
</p>



<h3>3.7.5 2023-01-01 - Background jobs</h3>
<p>
Some minor additions. Pressing @J we now see an "(output)" mark for running processes that have
generated unread output. Also changed selection of process for @JFG ("Job to ForeGround") to select
from all running processes.
</p>
<p>
Modified output a bit, to visually mark difference between "command mode" and Job output mode. 
</p>


<h3>3.7.5 2022-12-31 - Background jobs</h3>
<p>
Improved handling of background jobs via "& Expr". Showing "stdin" status if job is pending on input. 
When bringing jobs to the foreground, we only select between those waiting for stdin. Also improved
the "Jobs:ToForeground" function significantly.
</p>



<h3>3.7.4 2022-12-27 - Command history</h3>
<p>
Implemented a history function, where we store time + current dir + command.
</p>
<p>
Looks up field historyCommand in CFT.props, which calls Lib:HistoryAppend, where
we store data in Db2
</p>
<p>
Also created Lib:HistoryShow, and shortcut @H to run it.
</p>
<p>
Here we can both repeat a command (in the proper directory) or just change to 
a previous directory.
</p>




<h3>3.7.3 2022-12-26 - Moved "bang commands"</h3>
<p>
Bang commands were previously detected in Root input loop, moved
this into the command parser for shell-like commands, which enables
using expressions like with other shell-like commands
</p>
<p>
Keeping the BangParser script for now, but may delete it later, as it only
runs the command with Dir.run
</p>

<h3>3.7.2 2022-12-24 - Moved "shell" command</h3>
<p>
Instead of polluting global name space as a function in ObjGlobal, it is
now detected inside the command parser for shell-like commands.
</p>
<p>
Also deleted the meaningless ObjConvert (Std.Convert) object, which though it
raised the number of member functions, is never used, and does not belong in 
system space.
</p>

<h3>3.7.1 2022-12-24 - Updated license headers</h3>
<p>
Modified Java and script files
</p>


<h3>3.7.0 2022-12-24 - Renamed global function Lib() to Std()</h3>
<p>
Having both a Lib() function and a Lib script is confusing.
</p>


<h3>3.6.3 2022-12-15 - minor mod (assign)</h3>
<p>
	Moved the stack pop assign from being an Expr to being a Stmt, so that it does not have
	to return anything. This means a sequence of these assignments can pick a sequence of
	values off the top of the stack. Just an "itch" :-)
</p>


<h3>3.6.2 2022-12-15 - created interactive (shell command) grep</h3>
<pre>
grep "xyz" *.txt
</pre>
<p>
Runs via mGrep to Lib:GrepFiles
</p>


<h3>3.6.2 2022-12-13 - extended parsing :N</h3>
<p>
	Extended parsing of "colon commands" for :N where it is followed by something,
	converting :N to "Sys.lastResult(N)" and running the code.
</p>
<pre>
ls
:0.name
</pre>

<h3>3.6.2 2022-12-13 - shell + Dir/File protection</h3>
<p>
	When executing expressions, if resulting Dir/File is protected, then
	for the unsafe commands, like rm, mv and cp target, mkdir and touch, 
	throw exception.
</p>


<h3>3.6.1 2022-12-12 - shell command 'hex'</h3>
<p>
   Added shell command hex, which shows hex dump of single file
</p>

<h3>3.6.1 2022-12-12 - improved shell parser / showtree / hash</h3>
<p>
   Added correct handling of strings inside % and : (isExpr==true) expressions, and
   also prevented reaching parCount==0 from terminating the part, when isExpr; only
   space outside nested strings and string literals, terminates that.
</p>
<p>
	Needed to include quotes characters when starting and stopping strings, if isExpr.
</p>
<pre>
lsd
mkdir :0.name+"_2"
:-)
</pre>

<p>
	Added shell command <i>showtree</i>, which calls mShowtree lambda in CFT.props, which
	in turn calls Lib:ShowTree. Also updated docs and the _Shell command.
</p>
<p>
	Cleaned up lambda calling code in ShellCatEditMoreTail, to be in line with the rest.
</p>
<p>
	Also added command <i>hash</i> which calls mHash and in turn Lib:HashFiles.
</p>


<h3>3.6.0b 2022-12-11 - improved shell parser</h3>
<p>
	Fixed weakness in shell parser, so that we can make complete expressions when
	shell command parameter starts with symbol lookup '%' and Sys.lastResult reference ':'.
</p>
<pre>
lsf subdir
cd :0.dir     # go to dir of first file in list  

# or

lsf subdir
:0            # colon command works as before 
cd :.dir      # referring Sys.lastResult without list index
</pre>
<p>
	Likewise with symbol lookups:
</p>
pwd
%%a

cd %a,sub(",,")
</pre>

<p>
	For expressions with symbol references inside, use ()'s to mark it as an expression.
</p>
<p>
	Also note, since colon lookup of Sys.lastResult is NOT a general expression (which symbol lookups are), it can not
	be used inside expressions. The colon lookups in CFT shell-like commands, only works there
	and only when an argument starts with the ':'.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Further note:</b> we can not make :N a global function, because the parser will confuse it with
	the syntax for calling functions in other scripts.
</p>

<p>
	Also added optional pos parameter to Sys.lastResult, to get value from List.
</p>


<h3 class="tag">3.6.0 2022-12-11 - complete rewrite shell-commands</h3>
<p>
	Added special notation to shell command args, so that typing ':' results in the
	Sys.lastResult value, and :N results in Sys.lastResult.nth(N)
</p>

<p>
	The colon command :N works as before, the above only applies to parameters to CFT shell functions.
</p> 
<p>
	Updated doc, including symbols + updated _Shell global function. 
</p>
<p>
	Calling this version 3.6.0, as the shell-like command parser has now been completely re-engineered,
	with many improvements, including "destructive" commands to move, copy and delete files and directories.
</p>


<h3>3.5.6 2022-12-11 Implemented shell command 'diff'</h3>
<p>
	Added 'diff' command to compare two files. Considered adding File.diff, but diff is an 
	interactive command. To check if two files match with code, use File.hash
</p>
<p>
	This command invokes lambda mDiff defined in CFT.props, which in turn calls Lib:DiffFiles
</p>


<h3>3.5.6 2022-12-11 Sanity checks</h3>
<p>
	Added sanity checks for 'mv' and 'cp' to ensure not copying or 
	moving between two directories where one is a subdirectory of the other.
</p>
<p>
	Only applies to directory copying, and note that for example "cp someDir .." is
	not forbidden, since it actually means "cp someDir ../someDir", and current
	dir and ../someDir are independent.
</p>


<h3>3.5.6 2022-12-10 Implemented shell command 'cp'</h3>
<p>
	Same logic as in rm - but implemented completely in Java, no calls to CFT code space via lambdas.
</p>
<p>
	Also implemented File.touch function to complement the shell command
</p>
<p>
	Updated doc/Doc.md
</p>


<h3>3.5.6 2022-12-09 Implemented shell command 'mkdir'</h3>
<p>
	Don't need rmdir, as rm handles directories
</p>


<h3>3.5.6 2022-12-09 Implemented shell command 'rm'</h3>
<p>
	It calls a lambda in CFT.props, mRm, which in turn calls
	Lib:RmFilesAndDirs for interactive confirmation as needed.
</p>


<h3>3.5.6 2022-12-09 Implemented shell command 'mv'</h3>
<p>
	Fully implemented in Java, no lambda and CFT code needed. Uses java.io.File.renameTo(), which
	may accept different things on different platforms.
</p>

<h3>3.5.5 2022-12-08 all old Shell commands rewritten</h3>
<p>
	Removed old implementation, and started using the code under rf.configtool.root.shell
</p>

<h3>3.5.4 2022-12-06 new parser for Shell commands</h3>
<p>
	Reimplemented Shell commands parser, to be used for existing shell commands (ls, cd, pwd, edit, more) and
	new commands (cp, mv, rm, mkdir, rmdir, diff, ...).
</p>

<h3>3.5.3 2022-12-01 Stored symbols</h3>
<p>
	After deciding CFT needs "destructive" shell-like commands, and wondering how to implement cp, mv and diff
	in an efficient way, particularly when spanning different directories, and also
	how to jump between various directories and files, the Symbols notation was invented.
</p>

<p>
	This consists of the following parts:
</p>
<ul>
<li>mSymGet and mSymSet lambdas defined in CFT.props, pointing to Lib:SymbolGet and Lib:SymbolSet</li>
<li>New expression ExprSymGetSet parsed via ExprTerminal, on format %%xxx to set and %xxx to read symbol value</li>
<li>ExprSymGetSet calls the two new lambdas. The Set stores the LastValue in Db2, and Get reads it back</li>
<li>Added a shortcut @% that lists and lets us delete symbols</li>
</ul>


<pre>
cd /some/project
pwd
%%proj

# ... later: go to that directory
%proj.cd 

# ... or list files 
%proj.files
</pre>

<p>
Both %x and %%x are valid expressions, and in a sense they are global variables, but intended for 
interactive use, and tied in with Sys.lastResult. Ideally we could have implemented %%x parsing inside the 
interactive command line interpreter instead of as a general language feature, to make that point clearer, 
but %%x is pretty useless inside general code, as it will always return Sys.lastResult, which is
fixed until next command line input is completed. 
</p>

<p>
Also added warning when trying to define symbol value that is neither File nor Dir, as thats what
the mechanism is mostly assumed to be used for, jumping between locations, comparing and copying
between locations, etc.
</p>

<h3>3.5.2b 2022-11-14 Improved Dir.newestFiles()</h3>
<p>
	Fixed bug that made it slow for large sets of files. Also swapped order of parameters to count, Glob?
</p>


<h3>3.5.2b 2022-11-06 Bug fix + ls improvement</h3>
<p>
	Fixed bug in Dir.newestFiles(), which required a glob expression but did not use it.
	Also made the glob parameter optional.
</p>
<p>
	Improved File age reporting by moving and improving the formatter from Date.Duration to
	util and using it in the ObjFile object.
</p>


<h3>3.5.2 2022-04-27 Debug tools</h3>
<p>
Added Sys.getCallHistory, and new statement setBreakPoint(strExpr), which also presents
call history, and asks if we should continue or abort.
</p>

<h3>3.5.1 2022-04-26 Doc.html</h3>
<p>
	Removed Doc.html after converting it to md-format, and manually edited
	the code sections that were messed up. Deleted two early scripts,
	the MD which converted HTML to md-format, and the Overview script
	which creates Overview.txt from the old Doc.html. 
</p>


<h3>3.5.0 2022-04-22 Doc.html</h3>
<p>
	Read through Doc.html and cleaned up a bit, adding some sections for better
	consistency.
</p>

<h3>3.5.0 2022-04-22 Classes version 2</h3>
<p>
	Changed classes from v3.3.2 in-function auto-inherit of function parameters, returning
   to a modified function definition:
</p>
<pre>
	# Class A
	# --
		P(1)=>x
		self.x=x
		...
	/class A
</pre>
<p>
	In both the old and current implementation, the aim is to generate a "class object",
	which can be used directly as an object, but also can be instantiated and copied into
	an ohter class object, which then becomes a sub-class of the first.
</p>
<p>
	The code above defines classes in the same way as functions, but instead of /name, we use
	the /class ... line, which comes in two variants:
</p>
<pre>
	/class A
	/class A as T
</pre>
<p>
	The A is the name of the function, which creates the class object, which is the one we 
	call. The optional part, T, is used to define the class object type. If no type is given, the type defaults
	to the class function name.
</p>
<p>
	The type of an object in CFT is kind of a "promise" or perhaps "an informal interface name", which
	is selected freely, to simplify functions and lambdas doing "as" type checking, not having to know all subclasses
	of some class, but instead either use a root class name or some other freely selected name to describe a
	set of features, and check for that.
</p>
<p>
	The OODemo script illustrates all this.
</p>



<h3>3.4.4 2022-04-18 Fixed '&' commands</h3>
<p>
	Creating ok string rep from commands following '&', but keeping the
	option to do "," (comma) and either an identifier without quotes,
	or a string expression.
</p>


<h3>3.4.4 2022-04-18 Lambdas are not synthesizable</h3>
<p>
	Currently Lambdas are anonymous functions that are defined within a script environment, and
	like other functions, have access to functions in that environment directly by name. This means
	we can not synthesize them and bring them back in code inside another script and expect
	them to work.
</p>
<p>
	The other option was to say Lambda's have no source file connection, which would in turn
	complicate call stack location handling, with reference to file and line, as for regular functions,
	which currently works.
</p>
<p>
	Have deleted the synthesize() implementation for ValueBlock.
</p>

<h3>3.4.3 2022-04-14 addDebug()</h3>
<p>
	Renamed previous printDebug() statement to addDebug(), and changed it to 
	call new method addDebug() in Stdio. Extended the CFTCallStackFrame to contain these debug lines, and
	letting Stdio.addDebug() add debug line to top stackframe. These debug lines are only displayed
	when something goes wrong, together with the stack trace.
</p>
<p>
	The point is that one can leave addDebug() statements in the code for a long time, as their output will
	only be displayed if there is a crash.
</p>

<h3>3.4.2 2022-04-13 Bug fix for predicate calls</h3>
<p>
	Doing xxx.?yyy is a nice short hand for tryCatch(xxx.yyy).ok, as a way of finding out
	if a function is supported, or runs okay. As this is an implicit try-catch, if the 
	check fails, it means there was an exception somewhere inside, and that messed up
	the CFT call stack.
</p>
<p>
	Fixed in DottedCall.java, with reference to Tests01:Test52 which was written before
	the fix, and verified to identify the problem, and now is ok.
</p>
<p>
	Issue came up as doing Util:ShowDict on an XMLNode (.show lambda). XMLNode objects contain closures. These are
	not synthesizable, and that's what crashed the code, as Util:ShowDict determines if 
	value synthesizable in order to present it properly. 
</p>


<h3>3.4.1 2022-04-08 CFT Stack trace fixes</h3>
<p>
	Fixed including CFT Stack listing in results from tryCatch() and tryCatchSoft(), at the
	same time maintaining correct state of the CFT stack. These return a Dict, where
	.stack now refers to CFT call stack, and for tryCatch() the java stack trace is renamed
	to .javastack.
</p>
<p>
	Had to fix Tests03 which depended on particular string in java stack accordingly.
</p>


<h3>3.4.0 2022-04-08 CFT Stack trace</h3>
<p>
	Whenever an error propagates to the Root.processInteractiveInput() method in Java, it displays a
	call stack. It exists in the Stdio class, as this is the object that persists across the
	exact scope we want to log stack trace for.
</p>


<h3>3.3.4 2022-04-08 JCIFS / SMB</h3>
<p>
	Needed to test CIFS/SMB library for Java. Created Lib.Util.CIFS. Will probably
	refrain from complicating the File object by making smb:// protocol an integrated
	part of it.
</p>
<pre>
https://www.jcifs.org/
https://github.com/codelibs/jcifs
</pre>

<h3>3.3.3 2022-04-06 Various </h3>
<p>
	Extended the "as" expression into a "testMode" or predicate mode, as follows:
</p>
<pre>
	3 as? int # true
	3 as? String # false
</pre>
<p>
	Also created new data structures for the XML script using classes. Parsing and pretty-printing mostly works. The
	query functions are a bit lacking. Maybe later.
</p>
<p>
	Modified the JSON script slightly to optionally filter out closures ("Callable") when using the PP function
	to pretty-print XML data.
</p>
<p>
	Updated Doc.html with info about classes.
</p>



<h3>3.3.2 2022-04-04 classes v1 </h3>
<p>
	Created the class block. It inherits parameters from the function it is in. It also inherits the name
	of the function for the class, unless specified explictly following the "class" keyword.
</p>
<p>
	Behind the scenes, the class expression sets up the self dictionary, then runs the block of code as a lambda,
	with "self" as a local variable, and 
	inheriting parameters from the function, and finally, returns the self object.
</p>
<pre>
# Test class
# --
	class {
		P(1) as String =&gt; name
		self.name=name
		self.present=Lambda{
			"&lt;b&gt;"+self.name+"&lt;/b&gt;"
		}
	}
/TestClass

# Example use
# --
	tc=TestClass("this is a test")
	tc.present
/example
</pre>

<h4>Inheritance</h4>
<p>
	Inheritance uses the fact that "self" is a dictionary, and has a .copyFrom(otherDict) function. This means that
	there is no path up the inheritance chain, but instead that we copy content from super-class to subclass.
</p>
<p>
	It is all about creating objects that reuse code. As we see below, the subclass updates its' self with
	content from super class ("TestClass"), then copies the reference to self.present into self.origPresent
	before redefining self.present, which in turn calls self.origPresent. This of course corresponds to
	"super.present()" in Java, but is more manual. There also is nothing preventing multiple inheritance, as
	the content of the "self" is managed programmatically in the class block.
</p>
<pre>
# Subclass
# --
	class {
		P(1) as String =&gt; name
		
		# inheritance via copying object content
		self.copyFrom(TestClass(name))

		self.origPresent=self.present
		self.present=Lambda{
			# Calls inherited (copied) render function from TestClass
			@ &lt;p&gt;Extra text&lt;/p&gt;&lt;&lt; self.origPresent &gt;&gt;
			.mergeExpr
		}
	}
/Subclass

# Example use
# --
	Subclass("test").present
/example2

</pre>

<h3>3.3.1 2022-04-04 "as" to check Dict types / Sys.currFunction</h3>
<p>
	Modified "as" to accept an &amp; (ampersand) in front of either the single Identifier, or
	the (Expr). If present, the type we check for is the "name" of Dict (via .getName - not a
	dictionary value). 
</p>
<p>
	Created Sys.currFunction, which gives the name of the current script function. For creating
	dictionary self=Dict(Sys.currFunction) when creating objects in functions, if we want our
	objects to have the same name as the function where defined.
</p>




<h2 class="tag">3.3.0 2022-04-03 Merged branch 3.3.0</h2>
<p>
	This marks version 3.3.0 - some intense 8-10 hours over two days; had to scrap first attempt from yesterday, and narrow
	the scope.
</p>

<h3>3.3.0 2022-04-03 DottedAssign for Dict.ident=Expr</h3>
<p>
	Modified ExprE which is the parent of DottedCall, and introduced a DottedAssign, which matches
	.ident=Expr and when current object is a Dict, performs the set(), and returns the Dict, as with .set()
</p>
<pre>
	d=Dict d.a=3 println("d.a=" + d.a)   ## "3"
</pre>
<p>
	Using the "_" underscore function, we can do the following:
</p>
<pre>
	Dict
		_.a="hello" 
		_.b="there" 
		_.c="mr" 
		_.d="president"
		=> data
	

	# or, using "normal" assign
	data = Dict
		_.a=1
		_.b=2
</pre>


<h3>3.3.0 2022-04-03 Closures / Dict / DottedCall</h3>
<p>
	Moved responsibility for Dict.xxx for value lookup instead of Dict.get("xxx") from Dict to DottedCall.java.
</p>
<p>
	Also modified DottedCall to detect when Dict.xxx returns a Closure, calling this directly, possibly with
	parameters as given.
</p>
<p>
	Created some tests in Tests01 script. Modified CFT code base, by searching for .call, and for the case where
	we have .identifier.call, the ".call" is removed. Note that inside Lambdas in objects, we still need to 
	use self to access object content.
</p>
<p>
	Example from Tests01
<pre>
# Object functions calling each other - still uses self
# --
	Dict
		.set("baseValue",Lambda{
			1
		})
		.set("add",Lambda{
			P(1,0) as int=&gt;x self.baseValue+x ## identical syntax for variables and no-parameter lambda
		})
	=&gt; d
	d.add(5)==6
/Test42_object_lambda_calling_member_lambda
</pre>


<h2 class="tag">2022-04-03 Created branch 3.3.0</h2>


<h3>3.2.5 2022-03-31 Added "as" for type checking</h3>
<p>
	Doing error(getType(x) != "String", "Expected string") can now be written as:
</p>
<pre>
	x as String
	x as String?    # '?' means "or null"
</pre>
<p>
	Also added support for expression, so that we can say
</p>
<pre>
	x as ("int String".split)
	x as ("int String".split)?   # '?' means "or null"
</pre>
<p>
  Added a section to documentation and created some simple tests in Tests01 script.
</p>
<p>
	Also updated the type string for null-values to "null" instead of "&lt;null-type&gt;"
</p>


<h3>3.2.4 2022-03-25 File.getTimes and File.setTimes</h3>
<p>
	For when we want to copy files and preserve time information, etc
</p>

<h3>3.2.3 2022-03-20 Various minor fixes</h3>
<p>
	Nothing really major. 
</p>

<h3>3.2.2 2022-03-17 Lib.DDD.Bezier</h3>
<p>
	Modified File.encrypt/decrypt to allow for parallellizing the encryption
	and decryption, as the encryption algorithm is heavily CPU-bound. Added simple
	implementation now, not using threads. Writing a magic mark at the start of
	encrypted files, and in this way remaining compatible with the old (serial) code,
	that maintains a single Encrypt-object through the complete file.
</p>
<p>
	Have verified that fallback to old implementation works, using the BackupProgram script. All new 
	encryptions of files use the new "blocked" code, which is detected on decrypt via magic bytes.
</p>
<p>
	Should also make it harder to do analysis on encrypted data, since every 16k a new setting is 
	used.
</p>


<h3>3.2.1 2022-02-12 Lib.DDD.Bezier</h3>
<p>
	Added Bezier curve for 3d. Also added function .moveTo(absoluteVector) for Lib.DDD.Ref, and created demo script
	DDDBezier under code.examples.
</p>

<h3>3.2.0 2022-02-11 Removed Lib.Integrations</h3>
<p>
	Deleted the Sentry integration and with it the Lib.Integrations object, reducing
	complete JAR file from 1.5 MB to 900 KB, and once again; having no external dependencies.
</p>


<h3>3.1.1 2022-01-29 edit does not create non-existing file</h3>
<p>
	This was added in 2.9.11 together with "touch" functionality. Reverted edit function to 
	protest if file does not exist.
</p>

<h3>3.1.0 2022-01-28 File character sets</h3>
<p>
	Added support for File object to detect BOM mark when object is created (if file exists), setting internal encoding property.
</p>
<p>
	Modified create() to write BOM if one is defined for current encoding. Doing the same for append() for the case when
	the file does not exist, or is empty (length==0).
</p>
<p>
	Created java method ObjFile.getBufferedReader() which handles skipping the BOM mark if defined for current encoding,
	and applied this to read() and more(). 
</p>
<p>
	Also modified the following, to use ObjFile.getBufferedReader(): 
	ObjDataFile, ObjGrep, ObjLineReader, ObjPlot
</p>

<h3>3.0.7 2021-12-25 Terminal handling</h3>
<p>
	Added -noterm flag to CFT, to disable terminal checking, when running CFT via SSH, as ioctl complains and
	terminates the process otherwise.
</p>
<p>
	This is the basis for the Term.isTerminal function, which if false, first off sets wrap=true in the
	default Term object, and second, is used to prevent Lib:GetTerminalSize from examining 
	terminal size (when flag -noterm which means Term.isTerminal=false)
</p>
<p>
	Bugfix LockServer.setShuttingDown(): if there runs a server on local host already, in another instance or
	thread, the internal variable serverLoop will be null.
</p>

<h3>3.0.6 2021-12-22 Java script</h3>
<p>
	Modified Java script so that installing or updating CFT also creates a script in the home directory, 
	called RunCFT, to make it easier to call CFT remotely ...
</p>

<h3>3.0.5 2021-12-22 Locks cleanup</h3>
<p>
	Added code so that Root.java when input loop fails (CTRL D on linux) or when typing :quit, new method
	LockManager.setShuttingDown() is called, which ends up setting flag inside LockServer.ServerLoop so that
	it terminates. Its socket read blocks for only 200 ms at a time, so it terminates quickly.
</p>
<p>
	Did some minor cleanups as well. Moved the Lock-related classes to rf.configtool.root.
</p>


<h3>3.0.4 2021-12-19 DD improvements and verification</h3>
<p>
	Created DDGraphs script, with Torus and an interesting 720 degrees Helix illustration, which presents values
	sorted, so biggest first. Turned out great!
</p>
<p>
	Deleted rotation operations from Lib.DD.Vector, to avoid confusion, since the DD universe has some inherent
	issues regarding the meaning of left and right. Now it works, and that's good enough, even though .fwd is along
	the X axis from left to right. 
</p>
<p>
	Also fixed the DD.Vector.sub() as well as DDD.Vector.sub()
	to be intuitive (reversing the direction of the arrow), so that x.sub(y) returns vector from point y to point x.
	Updated doc on both functions to be identical. 
</p>
<p>
	Changed default background color for DDD.Viewer to white, and verified Torus from DDDExample. Also extended
	number of colors from 9 to 12.
</p>
<p>
	Added Lib.DD.Brush.setLinesOnly to render what is normally a sequence of filled polygons, as lines only, for
	better control while developing a model.
</p>


<h3>3.0.3 2021-12-19 DD improvements</h3>
<p>
	The Lib.DD package seems to work. Ref.fwd is along the X-axis, which for 2D is
	to the right, with Y up.
</p>
<p>
	Created DDExample, which draws the same wooden wheel as in DDDExample (3D).
</p>
<p>
	Created 2D brush that drags a line segment through 2D space, for filled areas, and created DDExample2 which draws
	the same wheel with this brush, which renders as filled 4-point polygons.
</p>



<h3>3.0.2 2021-12-19 Dir.newestFile and .newestFiles</h3>
<p>
	Dir.newestFile(): fixed so glob can be a string. Then added Dir.newestFiles(glob,count), which returns
	list of files, sorted newest first. For directories with huge number of files, this should be far more
	efficient than creating ObjFile objects for all, when doing this operation in CFT code.
</p>


<h3>3.0.1 2021-12-18 BangParser</h3>
<p>
	Fixed plain globbing with BangParser, which means current directory only, such as "*.txt", but not "somePath/*.txt".
	Also tried to fix quotes for Windows, as PowerShell requires quotes even when calling Dir:Run with list of parts.
	Will test this on windows later. 
</p> 



<h2 class="tag">2021-12-17 v3.0.0</h2>

<p>
	As version 2.0.0 was created in November of 2020, I wasn't sure there would be a version 3, since so much
	had already fallen into place. This file, the change log, is useful for getting an idea of all that has happened
	over the last year. The java code has increased from 20k to 30k lines, and the script library has
	more than doubled, from 5k to 12.7k lines.
</p>
<p>
	In addition to all that's described in this file, there have been many minor additions to system objects.
	Just two days ago, I added .fmt() to int and float values, for better presentation, plus three functions (asDays, asHours, asMinutes)
	to the Date.Duration object, in order to work meaningfully with the output from Date diffs. 
</p>
<p>
	Also, most of the script development is not documented via separate versions, and then there is the complete video tutorial
	on Youtube, along with a list of shorter HOWTO videos.
</p>
<p>
	I did not consider moving to version 3.0.0 until I got the background jobs in place. That mechanism has been something
	I've pondered for a long time, wanting to get it right. As it turned out okay, it suddenly felt like
	version 3.
</p>
<p>
	So will there be a version 4? I guess so.
</p>
<P>
	My offline TODO list still contains a few big ideas and many improvements, and more will surface under way. The point, or
	at least my point, is not just to make stuff, but to fit it in with the existing system, in an elegant way, 
	offering advanced functionality, and doing it in a way that works through the utterly primitive line based text interface.
</p>
<p>
	CFT is still my daily tool for almost everything. 
</p>
<p>
	Now if only the bang commands could do globbing, and have the quotes work in Windows, and ... and .. 
</p>



<h3>2.12.1 2021-12-16 Background jobs</h3>
<p>
	Created alternative notation for the SpawnProcess() expression:
</p>
<pre>
   & expr
   & expr, name
</pre>
<p>
	The name is either an identifier or an expression, typically a string. This extends the default name,
	which is "(n)", for readability.
</p>

<p>
	Updated the _Expr global documentation function.
</p>

<p>
	Also modified the Sys.Jobs and the Jobs script from yesterday, as well as the shortcuts
	defined in CFT.props. Developed a crude way of bringing a running job to the foreground, 
	so that jobs stalled on input, can be supplied with input data. 
</p>
<h4>Some details</h4>
<p>
	As the Input object is unaware of threads, the "last value" functionality becomes unreliable
	if there are more than one job running the same code, because one may update the "last value" after
	another has blocked on the same input, telling the user what was the "last value" at that point,
	causing confusion. 
</p>
<p>
	The rapid development of background jobs was driven by a very specific need at work, with slow servers and tens of
	thousands of log files that needed to be "massaged" into meaningful subsets, stored in Db2, for
	further inspection. The problem was that searching the remote directories for the latest file for some 
	Glob pattern, was way too slow to repeat for every inspection. I wrote some "update"-functions which extracted
	subsets of files, and stored them in the database, and now these functions can be run in the background. Very nice.
</p>
<h4>Inside code</h4>
<p>
	Even though the '&' expression (ExprAmp internally) is runnable from general code, it is limited compared
	to SpawnProcess, as it can not refer variables. On the command line that is not a problem, since we
	don't have any variables around anyway. Also there is the thing that jobs created with ExprAmp are added
	to the internal registry, and returns the job name. 
</p>
<p>
	In code we will normally use SpawnProcess, which returns an ObjProcess object.
</p>
<p>
	Still, any code can easily use ExprAmp, when we want to automate generating background jobs for further management
	via the Jobs script (which in turn uses the Sys.Jobs object).
</p>
<p>
	Also deleted the Cron script from 2.9.10, as it adds nothing of value any more.
</p>


<h3>2.12.0 2021-12-15 Sys.Jobs + Jobs script</h3>
<p>
	Fixed minor bug in ObjProcess, ensuring that supplied Dictionary is completely copied. Then added Java class BackgroundProcesses, which is available via the Root object. Managing it is done by creating the Sys.Jobs object, which in turn is used by a new
	"Jobs" script.
</p>
<p>
	CFT needs a mechanism for running stuff in the background and get notice when completed, and
	a specialized "session store" for ObjProcess objects was required, as ObjProcess instances can
	not be stored in Db2 (not synthesizable).
</p>
<p>
	This kind of breaks the claim of "no shared state", but it's a specialized store, for background jobs only, and
	written to be thread-safe both internally (managing running threads) and externally, as called from CFT code,
	including the command line.
</p>


<h3>2.11.0 2021-12-12 DD package</h3>
<p>
	Moved 2D vectors from Lib.Math to Lib.DD, and modeled it after the DDD library, including viewer. 
</p>
<p>
	Status still uncertain, not really mature. The brush object and rendering is mostly a hack. It's fast though.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Not included into the Doc yet</b>
</p>


<h3>2.10.1 2021-12-10</h3>
<p>
	Got verified it works on Windows. Added timeout for serverSocket, to ensure proper termination, and 
	ran the LockTest.java program. Renamed LockFile to LockManager, and simplified the interface, to 
	match that of Lib.Db, using simple strings for lock names, not files.
</p>

<h3>2.10.1 2021-12-09 rewrote LockFile.java</h3>
<p>
	rf.configtool.main.runtime.lib.db.LockFile
</p>
<p>
	Rewritten for 3rd time, now using a local TCP/IP-daemon, as the lock files didn't really work, particulary
	on windows. Still needs some cleanup, when terminating, just needs to verify that this works on 
	all platforms.
</p>


<h3>2.10.0 2021-12-05 Including DDD library</h3>
<p>
	It works. Still needs some polishing, creating more Brush functions, to create predefined
	brushes to drag through 3d space. 
</p>


<h3>2.10.0 2021-12-04 Including DDD library</h3>
<p>
	Lib.DDD
</p>
<p>
	My 3D library written around year 2000, is about to be included into CFT, for simple 3D modelling
	and rendering to file. The code never was fast, but it worked. 
</p>
<p>
	The integration is mostly complete, but there is trouble with java.awt from OpenJDK. Planned on
	using the RasterImage class, but must figure out the java.awt trouble first.
</p>
<p>
	It was simple: Just reinstalled openjdk ...
</p>


<h3>2.9.13 2021-12-02</h3>
<p>
	Moved global Filter() into Lib.Text
</p>


<h3>2.9.12 2021-11-30</h3>
<p>
	Improved LockFile.java (rf.configtool.main.runtime.lib.db) with internal timeout of 10 seconds. No valid
	task requiring a lock file should take more than that. This is the implementation behind collection locking
	in Lib.Db.Db2 and functions Lib.Db.obtainLock() and .releaseLock()
</p>
<p>
	The weakness of not timing out a bad lock from a crashed client, quickly became evident when incorporating
	the Cron:o function in the prompt code of CFT.props, as there must have been some crash, leaving the lock
	to access the Cron jobs in at least one environment. Reinstated that call into CFT.props as well.
</p>

<h3>2.9.11 2021-11-29</h3>


<h4>"ls" default behaviour</h4>
<p>
	Added safeguards to default "ls" processing (when no parameters such as *.txt etc), so that it times out if
	operation of traversing directory entries takes too long, or if the number of entries is very large. 
</p>
<p>
	If this happens, the files and directories located so far, are displayed as before, followed by a system
	message informing of the truncation and why, and to use "*" to override, as the glob parsing for the terminal
	commands is processed commonly in the StmtShellInteractive class.
</p>


<h4>"touch"</h4>
<p>
	Added "touch", to update timestamp of file or create new empty file. Returns File object.
</p>

<p>
	Updated global function _Stmt in ObjGlobal with "touch"
</p>


<h4>"edit" improvement</h4>
<p>
	When typing 'edit xxx.txt' if file xxx.txt does not exist, it is automatically created.
</p>


<h3>2.9.10 2021-11-20 Cron script</h3>
<p>
	Created Cron script as a proof of concept, for running things in the background, and be notified when done. Used the
	additional third argument to SpawnProcess from v2.9.3 which is a lambda or closure running in the
	invoking context, handling output and status update from running Process. Also using named locks from
	2.9.4 (improved and moved to Lib.Db in 2.9.8).
</p>
<p>
	Extended Closure with functions .dict and .lambda to access its constituents, because storing closures in
	Db2 requires us to store the dict and the lambda separately, and recreate the closure when about to
	invoke it.
</p>

<h3>v2.9.9 2021-11-15 AValue</h3>
<p>
	Created global function AValue which creates AnnotatedValue object. In preparation for improved XML parser, and all other
	situations where extra information about values are needed. 
</p>

<h3>v2.9.8 2021-11-12</h3>
<p>
	Improved the LockFile.java over multiple iterations. Also improved the test class, TestLock (Java), which 
	ensures robustness of locks. 
</p>
<p>
	Moved Lib.Db.Db2 functions for locks to Lib.Db.
</p>
<p>
	Improved the Util:Counter function with an internal transaction lock, and
	created a test for it in Tests04 / Test01_xxx
</p>
<p>
	This should fix previously identified unstabilities with temporary files, which
	depend on the Util:Counter for uniqueness.
</p>

<h3>v2.9.7 2021-11-10 Dict name</h3>
<p>
	Added "name" property of Dictionary objects. It can be set at creation Dict("name") or via
	Dict.setName. It's a preparation for an improved XML parser.
</p>


<h3>v2.9.6 2021-11-10 Db2 FileLock (Java)</h3>
<p>
	The previous version of the FileLock from 2.8.3 was flawed, and has been improved, at the cost of a
	1/20 second delay when attempting to get a lock.
</p>


<h3>v2.9.5 2021-10-30 Adjustments</h3>
<p>
	Modified Dir.files(), Dir.allFiles(), Dir.dirs() and Dir.allDirs() to accept
	string for the Glob parameter, or Glob object.
</p>
<p>
	Created List.get() as an alias for List.nth() as .get() is more intuitive.
</p>
<p>
	Added Sys.scriptId() function. Meant for uniquely storing data in Db2. Returns
	the full path of the script, with no special characters, and no space.
</p>

<h3>v2.9.4 2021-10-19 Added Lib.Db object functions</h3>
<pre>
Lib.Db.Db2.obtainLock(name,timeoutMillis)
Lib.Db.Db2.releaseLock(name)
Lib.Db.Db2.getLockFile(name)
</pre>

<h3>v2.9.3 2021-10-18 Extended SpawnProcess</h3>
<p>
	Added third parameter to SpawnProcess,
	supplying a Lambda or Closure to be called from a monitor thread inside ObjProcess
	whenever there is output, or the process has terminated (with an exitValue). 
</p>
<p>
	Allows async data collection from running background processes, which may be aggregated
	in Db2, to file, or printed to screen. 
</p>
<pre>
SpawnProcess(Dict,expr,Lambda{P(1)=&gt;process process.output-&gt;line println(line)})
</pre>
<p>
	Being a Lambda, and as there is no global state, and the ObjProcess object being thread
	safe, it can at least not do any harm.
</p>


<h3>v2.9.2 2021-10-17 Added List.mergeExpr</h3>
<p>
	Templating with List, Sequence or "here" documents, we can just add
	.mergeExpr and execute all expressions inside the lines of text.
</p>
<p>
	See WebTest script or Tests01.
</p>


<h3>v2.9.1 2021-10-16 removed MS SQL client</h3>
<p>
	Removed the Lib.Integrations support for MS SQL, as the code was primitive, and the 
	dependency added 1300 Kb to the size of the jar-file.
</p>

<h3>v2.9.1 2021-10-16 String.mergeExpr</h3>
<p>
	Created mergeExpr() function on String. It evaluates expressions inside <<...>> or
	custom start/end-markers as parameters to the mergeEval() function.
</p>
<pre>
	a=5 b=6 "a=&lt;&lt;a&gt;&gt; b=&lt;&lt;b&gt;&gt;".mergeExpr
</pre>



<h3>v2.9.0 2021-10-11 Lib.Web.Server</h3>
<p>
	Created experimental web-server inside CFT. See script WebTest for details. 
</p>


<h3>v2.8.3 2021-10-03 Db2 improvements</h3>
<p>
	Created lock files for reading and writing collection data, and compacting
	collections where there are many redefines of values. 
</p>


<h3>v2.8.2 2021-10-03 Global function _Expr</h3>
<p>
	Added global help function _Expr, similar to _Stmt. 
</p>

<h3>v2.8.1 2021-10-02 Code cleanup</h3>
<p>
	Added some comments, plus created _example function inside Lib.Text.Lexer object.
	Previously added _example function to Lib.Java. After the addition of _Stmt function
	to ObjGlobal, all functions starting with underscore are presented first when running
	"help".
</p>
<pre>
	Lib.Java._example
	Lib.Text.Lexer._example
</pre>


<h3>v2.8.0 2021-10-01 Some renaming</h3>
<p>
	Renamed some major packages, creating rf.configtool.lexer (previously called .parser) and
	rf.configtool.parsetree (previously .data)
</p>
<p>
	Added a bit of comments in key classes as well.
</p>


<h3>v2.7.4 2021-09-30 minor improvement :NN</h3>
<p>
	Changed the colon command for synthesizing an element in list, so that it also modifies
	the lastResult value. Have also created a function in Lib script, GetLastResultFile, which
	is used in CFT.props, as default for cat, edit and more when no file given!
</p>
<p>
	The result is that we can now do this:</p>
</p>
<p>
	ls
	:3    # synthesizes but also updates lastResult
	edit  # edit 3'rd file (now lastResult)
</p>


<h3>v2.7.3 2021-09-29 _Stmt() function</h3>
<p>
	Added function _Stmt() to GlobalObject, which when run displays info
	about the statements in CFT. 
</p> 


<h3>v2.7.2 2021-09-26 2D-vector math</h3>
<p>
	Added ancient code for 2D vector math, back from 2001. Needed this to do 
	material and angle calculations, building a garden shed :-)
</p>
<p>
	The Lib.Math.DD object contains a single function, Vec(x,y), but considering
	adding simple renderer in here.
</p>
<pre>
# Utility
# --
	Lib.Math.DD.Vec(P(1),P(2))
/vec

vec(10,0).rotate(45).x
</pre>



<h3>v2.7.1 2021-09-09 Dead code removal</h3>
<p>
	Removed unused code from Java package rf.configtool.util.net. 
</p>
<p>
	Added JavaObject function getFieldValue. Removed some Java class references
	that were not used.
</p>

<h3>v2.7.0 2021-09-08 Lib.Java</h3>
<p>
	Created Lib.Java object and functionality for locating classes, constructors and methods,
	and call those. Example:
</p>
<pre>
Lib.Java.forName("java.lang.String") =&gt; String
String.getConstructor(String).call(Lib.Java.String("test")) =&gt; obj
String.getConstructor(String).call(Lib.Java.String("123")) =&gt; obj2
Lib.Java.Object(obj2) =&gt; paramObj
String.getMethod("concat",String).call(obj,paramObj).value
/test
</pre>
<p>
	It returns "test123". Added this code to Tests01 script, as it
	verifies most of the functionality.
</p>



<h3>2021-09-07 bug</h3>
<p>
	Found bug, added as test in Tests01, as Test13.
</p>

<h3>v2.6.4 2021-09-01</h3>
<p>
	Added simple MS SQL objects to Lib.Integrations object.
	JAR file has grown from under 700k to almost 2.5M (including Sentry in v2.5.9).
</p>


<h3>v2.6.3 2021-08-28</h3>
<p>
	Added function Sys.lint to parse all functions in current script, checking for valid syntax 
</p>
<p>
	Renamed rarely used "debug" stmt to printDebug, and modified it to include source location, 
	plus adding log lines to the "system messages" set, which is presented after all code has
	completed. 
</p>
<p>
	Added function Lib.Util.random()
</p>


<h3>v2.6.2 2021-08-28</h3>
<p>
	Fixed println() so it respects terminal size
</p>

<h3>v2.6.1 2021-08-27</h3>
<p>
	Added function Sys.environment for environment variables, returns Dict.
</p>
<pre>
	Util:ShowDict(Sys.environment)
</pre>


<h3>v2.6.0 2021-08-27</h3>
<p>
	Fixed some long-time bugs detected earlier. Now Lambdas and Inner blocks behave
	as they should. In Tests01 script, fixed tests number 9, 11 and 12.
</p>
<p>
	All tests okay, which means no know bugs.
</p>
<pre>
	Tests01:RunAll
	Tests02:RunAll
	Tests03:RunAll
</pre>

<h3>v2.5.10 2021-08-24</h3>
<p>
	Improved the @c and @v shortcuts, which copy files to "clipboard" and paste them to current directory.
	With the clipboard existing in Db2, files can easily be copied into it in one session, and from it
	in another on the same host.
</p>
<p>
	Modified Glob("x") to ignore case on windows platform only.
</p>
<p>
	Improved Date.Duration.fmt function for readability.
</p>
<p>
	Improved the @S shortcut searching for files under current dir, changed it to @FS (File Search)
</p>
<p>
	Created new shortcut @FL (File Locate) and corresponding Lib function for locating files
	under current dir
</p>




<h3>v2.5.9 2021-08-22</h3>
<p>
	Added Lib.Integrations.Sentry for testing Sentry.io 
</p>


<h3>v2.5.8b 2021-08-21</h3>
<p>
	Added File.encrypt() and File.decrypt()
</p>
<p>
	Created BackupProgram script for running incremental backups to some (shared) directory,
	using full encryption.
</p>


<h3>v2.5.8 2021-08-21</h3>
<p>
	Added global function Binary(hexString) to create Binary object.
</p>
<p>
	Also added Binary.hash() function.
</p>



<h3>v2.5.7 2021-07-11 Dir getContentDescription()</h3>
<p>
	Removed counting files and directories inside directory, as this may take
	a long time when working with remote directories, and is rarely of any
	value.
</p>


<h3>v2.5.6 2021-06-16 '?' command</h3>
<p>
	Changed '?' to include only "public" functions (not defined as //func, which are
	"private" functions).
</p>
<p>
	Added support for '??' to show all functions as before. 
</p>


<h3>v2.5.5 2021-06-09 Maven</h3>
<p>
	Stopped using ANT, changed to MAVEN.
</p>


<h3>v2.5.4 2021-05-08 Profiling - Obj.add(Function)</h3>
<p>
	Profiling revealed that this function consumes 65% of the time. 
</p>
<p>
	Considering that int and string objects are often just used for comparison,
	without calling internal functions, an additional Obj.setFunctions() taking an array,
	which at the first call to getFunction() or needing to produce help text, is 
	copied into the functions map.
</p>
<p>
	This reduced runtime from 8 to 6.3 seconds for a CPU-intensive test.
</p>
<p>
	Further optimization took the time from 6.3 to 4.2 seconds. Among those are
	letting Lib and Sys and Lib.Data be singletons. 
</p>


<h3>v2.5.3 2021-05-06 XML parser</h3>
<p>
	Created simple XML parser in CFT. It is available as XML script. An improvement
	might be creating a new object type for XML nodes, but this will do for now.
</p>


<h3>v2.5.3 2021-05-05 CodeLinesParseCache</h3>
<p>
	The CodeLines object represents a function body (as well as command line input). 
	Added a cache, to avoid having to tokenize and parse the function code over and
	over again. For a CPU-intensive test, this reduced runtime from 30 seconds to 8 seconds.
</p>


<h3>v2.5.2 2021-05-05 getExprCount() + timeExpr()</h3>
<p>
	Added global function getExprCount() which counts the number of times
	Expr.resolve() has been called per ObjGlobal, as a way of measuring
	code complexity etc.
</p>
<p>
	Also added statement timeExpr(expr)
</p>



<h3>v2.5.1 2021-05-01 Optimized Parser.java</h3>
<p>
	Profiling revealed that recreating the same CharTable every time Parser is instantiated, which
	is for every function call, created some overhead. A simple cache fixed that.
</p>


<h3>v2.5.0 2021-04-29 Major Parser update</h3>
<p>
	In order to support tokens spanning multiple lines, as needed by the XML parser,
	the parser code was modified. It is the same that parses CFT code.
</p>
<p>
	Also updated code using the parser: JSON, XML, BangParser and Util:ComplexPatternLineSearch
</p>
<p>
	Updated doc as well
</p>

<h3>v2.4.4 2021-04-27 XML parser v0.1</h3>
<p>
	Written rudimentary XML parser in CFT. :-)
</p>


<h3>v2.4.4 2021-04-22 clone()</h3>
<p>
	Removed inherited clone() function from all values and objects, added 
	instead function Sys.clone(any).
</p>


<h3>v2.4.3 2021-04-20 Input functions</h3>
<p>
	Added two functions to Input object
</p>
<pre>
	.getCurr
	.setCurrCond
</pre>

<h3>v2.4.2 2021-04-16 :load currentDir bug</h3>
<p>
	Auto load of scripts from non-script-path location, when current dir something else,
	did not work.
</p>

<h3>v2.4.1 2021-04-14 Bang command bug</h3>
<p>
	Sneaky bug with regards to current directory. Finally remembered that BangParser is
	a CFT script with its own "current dir". Passing current Dir in as parameter to its
	Run() function did the trick.
</p>

<h3>v2.4.0 2021-04-11 Bang command</h3>
<p>
	Added the "bang command" configurable parser, and created a default parser, with 
	the net result being that starting a command with a bang ("!"), the rest of the 
	line is processed by the CFT code defined for the bangCommand configuration property.
</p>
<p>
	In CFT.props it is in turn defined as calling BangParser:Run with the string. It
	parses and executes the command via Dir.run(). 
</p>


<h3>v2.3.9 2021-04-10 :save :load currentDir</h3>
<p>
	Changed :load to first look up scripts in the codeDirs sequence as defined in CFT.props,
	then if not found, check current directory.
</p>
<p>
	Also renamed CodeHistory to ScriptCode, and extended it to rememvber its full
	savefile location (if defined) and modified :save so that the location gets 
	updated on save.
</p>
<p>
	Saving a script that has no current savefile location, or entering a different
	name, the current directory is always used.
</p>


<h3>v2.3.8 2021-04-03 private functions</h3>
<p> 
	Allowing scripts to contain private (helper) functions, by naming them with two slashes
	instead of the normal one.
</p>

<p>
	Assuming the following is stored in script file Example:
<pre>
	23
	//a1

	22
	/a2
</pre>
<ul>
	<lI>
		With current script being the Example, typing '?' lists all functions, prefixing
		the local functions by '/'</lI>
	<li>
		Examining from outside via "?Example:", we don't see the local functions, and so
		only see function a2
	</li>
	<li>
		Examining from the outside with search term (or absolute name), we again work
		with the full set of functions. "?Example:a" shows both functions, again
		prefixing a1 with slash '/' to indicate it is local.
	</li>
	<li>
		And of course we can list a private function via "?Example:a1"
	</li>
</ul>



<h3>v2.3.7 2021-04-01 Input</h3>
<p>
	Added functions to Input
</p>
<pre>
	.setCurr(str)        - the default value when pressing Enter
	.clear()             - clear history and curr
	.getHistory()        - show history values
	.setHistory(list)    - set history values
</pre>



<h3>v2.3.6 2021-03-28 if()</h3>
<p>
	Corrected documentation, as the if() expression in traditional form 
	selects between <b>statements</b>, not just expressions, as in the inline form.
</p>


<h3>v2.3.6 2021-03-27 Tests03 scripts</h3>
<p>
	Created Tests03 script which verifies the protect mechanism of Dir and File objects.
</p>
<p>
	All tests passed :-)
</p>

<h3>v2.3.6 2021-03-26 Dict / Tests02</h3>
<p>
	Added key order to Dict, so that the .keys function returns keys in the order
	they were assigned. Also added a new script Tests02 under code.examples to 
	run through the different scenarios, including JSON parser / generator
</p>

<h3>v2.3.5 2021-03-13 Bugfix / Tests01</h3>
<p>
	The inner block had a bug, so that
</p>
<pre>
	List(1,2,3)-&gt;x {report(x)}
</pre>
<p>
	Resulted in sequence of 1 12 123. This was due to result processing for local blocks must
	differ from "isolated blocks" like Inner and Lambda.
</p>
<p>
	Also created first test script, called Tests01. Disovered another bug, which is that
	if an Inner block contains a single assert() or break, but no loop, the traversal-mechanism
	looking for nearest block escapes the Inner block, and affects the block outside.
	(Test09)
</p>


<h3>v2.3.4 2021-03-13 Dir.newestFile + improvements allFiles and allDirs</h3>
<p>
	Added function newestFile(Glob?) to easily fetch latest modified file. Also disovered that the
	allFiles() and allDirs() first collected all dir/files THEN applied glob if defined, which is
	inefficient, so improved this.
</p>

<h3>v2.3.3 2021-02-12 String .first(n) and .last(n)</h3>
<p>
	Added function first and last, similar to those of List, which gets substring. If string too short, 
	the whole string is returned.
</p>


<h3>v2.3.2 2021-02-12</h3>
<p>
	File.readBinary(): extended to take either zero params (reading whole file, as before), or two
	params: offset + count
</p>
<p>
	ValueBinary: added function printableChars() which returns a string of printable (7-bit) characters.
</p>
<p>
	This allowed the "poor mans EXIF implementation"; reading the first 64 Kb of data from a JPEG file,
	as binary, and searching for dates :-)
</p>


<h3>v2.3.1 2021-01-24 Assignment is expr</h3>
<p>
	Changed local variable assignments from statements to expressions, which has the
	advantage of allowing:
</p>
<pre>
	if (cond) a=1 

	a=b=c=0

	0=&gt;a=&gt;b=&gt;c
</pre>
<p>
	Also created common abstract superclass for all Expr classes, ExprCommon, with resolve(), and cleaned up the 
	ExprTerminal resolve() method. Renamed a few Expr classes to Expr* names.
</p>
<p>
	Removed List.push() function, as the following no longer works:
</p>
<pre>
	List.push(2) =&gt; a =&gt; b
</pre>
<p>
	It had only been used ONCE, so ... no loss.
</p>



<h3>v2.3.0 2021-01-24 Local blocks ...</h3>
<p>
	Making loops forbidden inside local blocks was a mistake. What must be forbidden
	is the pipe symbol, as a loop inside a local block adds data to the
	environment result list, not a local one, and so pipe has no meaning.
</p>

<p>
	This solves a common problem, illustrated by the following.
</p>

<pre>
List("aaa","bbb")-&gt;line
	{
		line.chars-&gt;c out(c)
	} 
	out("x")
/t
</pre>

<p>
	It generates list of characters aaaxbbbx. 
</p>
<p>
	Keeping the "Inner" block, as it is, as described in docs, kind of a mix between
	lambda and local code. Inner blocks can have PIPE because they run in a separate
	environment.
</p>




<h3>v2.2.4 2021-01-18 Security - Encrypt</h3>
<p>
	Adjustments to the rf.configtool.util.Encrypt java class.
</p>


<h3>v2.2.3 2021-01-07 File and Dir verification</h3>
<pre>
	Dir.verify(str)
	File.verify(str)
</pre>


<h3>v2.2.2 2020-12-27 Security</h3>
<p>
	Improved function Db2:GetSessionPassword to read password twice and check for match,
	before saving to Db (encrypted with Sys.secureSessionId) and returning it.
</p>
<p>
	Also added Lib.Util.randomBinary() function, that returns an SHA-1 hash of 
	a string that is sent as parameter + current time as millis + secureSessionId.
</p>


<h3>v2.2.1 2020-12-27 More security</h3>
<p>
	Added function Sys.secureSessionId() which returns a secure Binary. Extended the
	ValueBinary to an optionally safe version, which supports no functions, only to 
	be used as password or salt when encrypting data for storage in databases etc.
</p>
<p>
	Changing Lib.Util.Encrypt and Decrypt to expect Binary value for password, while
	making salt parameter optional, and of type string.
</p>
<p>
	Added check to File.binaryCreate() so it fails if the Binary is marked
	as secure, as the secure session binary must NEVER be exposed, as it
	will protect sensitive content in the database.
</p>
<p>
	Added Db2:GetSessionPassword function, for managing passwords in a secure way
	using the Sys.secureSessionId()
</p>


<h3>v2.2.0 2020-12-27 Password and encryption / Binary values</h3>
<p>
	Added function Sys.readPassword(). It requires the Stdio object to be instance of
	StdioReal (Java), which means it will fail inside parallel processes, example:
</p>
<pre>
$ SpawnProcess(Dict,Sys.readPassword("Enter password")).wait
/x

$ x.exitValue
null

$ x.output
0: Process fails with Exception: [&lt;func&gt; x:22] readPassword() requires StdioReal (java.lang.Exception)
</pre>

<p>
	Added new Value type Binary
</p>

<p>
	Added function String.getBytes() - returns Binary
</p>

<p>
	Added Lib.Util and Lib.Util.Encrypt() and Lib.Util.Decrypt()
</p>

<p>
	Added function process() to Encrypt/Decrypt binary data
</p>
<p>
	Added function processString() to Encrypt/Decrypt (same object), that returns hex string
	when encrypting, for string-only processing
</p>

<pre>
$ Lib.Util.Encrypt("roar","test").processString("roar")
D8EDECF0
$ /x                                             
$ Lib.Util.Decrypt("roar","test").processString(x)
roar
</pre>

<p>
	Added functions File.readBinary and File.binaryCreate
</p>





<h3>v2.1.8 2020-12-21 bugfix: onLoad exceptions</h3>
<p>
	Reporting error if onLoad fails, but still loads the script.
</p>

<h3>v2.1.7 2020-12-15 onLoad</h3>
<p>
	Created onLoad function processing. Example from Projects script:
</p>
<pre>
# Reset selected projects if new session
	if (Db2:Get("Projects","session") != Sys.sessionUUID) {
		Db2:Set("Projects","Project",null)
		Db2:Set("Projects","session", Sys.sessionUUID)
	}
/onLoad
</pre>	

<p>
	Also created CFT.props field globalOnLoad which is run when CFT starts. Calls Lib:GetTerminalSize. 
</p>

<p>
	Renamed old Cfg object to Term as that is what it deals with
</p>

<h3>v2.1.6 2020-11-27</h3>

<p>
	Improved String.synthesize: 
	Using hex encoding only when string contains non-printable characters,
	otherwise falling back to old implementation, for much improved
	readability of synthesized strings.
</p>

<p>
	Improved JSON parser by removing old code and correcting comment on
	Parse() function.

<p>
	Improved display of system log lines, so it respects screen width. Most
	frequently seen via the "help" statement.
</p>



<h3>v2.1.5 2020-11-26 List.filter</h3>
<p>
	Created List.filter which takes a callable (lambda or closure) as parameter,
	which is invoked for each element, 
	and returns list of non-null values.
</p> 

<h3>v2.1.4 2020-11-25 Sys.sessionUUID</h3>
<p>
	Letting the Root class generate a UUID-string, which is available via this
	function. Useful when saving session settings to database.
</p>

<h3>v2.1.3 2020-11-16 String functions</h3>
<p>
	Added toHexString and fromHexString and changed the syntesis function to use
	these. Old values in database with .unEsc will work as before.
</p>
<p>
	The point is to make non-printable characters made possible via Sys.uchar to
	be wrapped safely as printable text.
</p>


<h3>v2.1.2 2020-11-15 AppUI / Cfg / Sys.uchar / Curses script</h3>
<p>
	Created first version of AppUI script for standardizing application user interface in
	terminal.
</p>
<p>
	Changed Cfg.h and .w to return values without printing to stdout first
</p>
<p>
	Added function Sys.uchar() which can be made to produce any Unicode character, by entering
	the hex value. The preceding "\u" is optional. For example we can now produce the ANSI Esc
	character, and control color and cursor.
</p>
<pre>
	Sys.uchar("\u001b")+"[2J"     # print this to clear screen
</pre>
<p>
	Extended Sys.uchar to also allow integer value directly.
</p>
<p>
	Created Script Curses which uses ANSI escape codes for colors, clearing screen,
	and cursor control.
</p>



<h3>v2.1.1 2020-11-14 Error message from Lexer</h3>
<p>
	Fixed function processLine() to maintain internal line counter, to produce more accurate
	error messages for non-file input lines. For lines from files, there is a line number, 
	which the code uses along with file name.
</p>


<h3>v2.1.0 2020-11-14 Made Lambda synthesizable</h3>
<p>
	Also transferred this to Dict objects. 
</p>
<p>
	Note that lambdas added to a Dict are wrapped into Closures, but closures are not
	synthesizable. The Dict synthesis function creates code that adds the Lambda, 
	which just means a Closure object will be created when the code string is eval'ed.
</p>
<p>
	The string representation for lambdas isn't the prettiest, as it is generated from
	the tokens consumed while parsing, not the original character stream. But it works. 
</p>
<p>
	An improvement could be to let every token contain a string of all preceding whitespace,
	and use this to create better formatted synthesized code. Another day.
</p>


<h2 class="tag">2020-11-14 Tagging v2.0.0</h2>



<h3>v1.9.14 2020-11-13 List.sort etc</h3>
<p>
	Adding a section to the doc about sorting, it became clear that sorting on floats had never
	been implemented. It also has not been missed, but it was a quick fix.
</p>
<p>
	Also had some script updates today, and a fix in Db2 for maintaining high throughput for
	write-intensive cases (not reading the file back to update internal map before needed
	for queries). 
</p>
<p>
	Finally, yesterday evening the ProcessMonitor object was easily integrated into the Hosts
	script, for "apt update / upgrade" and "check out and compile latest CFT version". These
	caused the VM server with 30 VM's being executed simultaneously to spike violently for a long while
	before catching up. Using ProcessMonitor to run 4 parallel jobs at the time, increased
	throughput greatly.
</p>


<h3>v1.9.13 2020-11-12 ProcessMonitor</h3>
<p>
	Added function Util:ProcessMonitor that returns an object with lambdas for flow control when
	running parallel processes, as currently doing APT upgrade on 30 VM's on the same server
	takes forever, because of IO wait. Tried first to write in Java, but CFT was so
	much better suited for the task, with code being 14 lines (same as example of use below).
</p>
<pre>
# Test function
# --
	mon = Util:ProcessMonitor
	Lib.Data.each(0,20)-&gt;x
		mon.Lwait.call(4)
		println("Starting process " + x)
		proc = SpawnProcess(SymDict(x),{
			Sys.sleep(1000+x*100)
		})
		mon.Ladd.call(proc)
		out(proc)
	| _-&gt;proc
		proc.wait
		println("process " + proc.data.x + " done")
/t
</pre>	

<h3>v1.9.13 2020-11-12 File compression</h3>
<p>
	Added File.convertCompressed() which converts between various types of compression, based on
	file name (.z or .gz for GZIP, .zip for ZIP otherwise uncompressed)
</p>
<pre>
	File("x.txt").convertCompressed(File("x.txt.zip"))
	File("x.txt.zip").convertCompressed(File("a.txt"))
	File("x.txt").hash==File("a.txt").hash

	true
</pre>

<h3>v1.9.12 2020-11-06</h3>
<p><b> Hardening Db2</b></p>
<p>
	Should handle parallel access from multiple active CFT processes on same host, by detecting file updates
	and reloading when needed. 
</p>
<p>
	Lots of script updates
</p>
<h4>2020-11-12 emergency fix</h4>
<p>
	Added File functions setWriteLF() and setWriteCRLF to dictate how create() and append() work
</p>
<p>
	Greatly improved JSON parser, and included a PrettyPrinter
</p>
<pre>
	$ JSON:PP
</pre>


<h3>v1.9.11 2020-11-06 Dict .subset() .copyFrom() and global SymDict()</h3>
<p>
	Added Dict.subset(keyList,defaultValue). 
</p>
<p>
	Added Dict.copyFrom(Dict)
</p>
<p>
	Added global expression SymDict() which takes as parameters a list of identifier
	expressions.
</p>
<p>
	Added utility method to Ctx.java : resolveExpr (String s)
</p>

<pre>
a=1 b=2 SymDict(a,b)  # returns Dict with a=1, b=2
</pre>
<p>
	It does this by parsing for identifiers, then executing those as code, which resolves
	to values. It was meant for variables, but also works with output from functions
	without parameters.
</p>
<pre>
$ a=1 b=2 SymDict(a,b,Dir)=>x Util:ShowDict(x)
 &lt;List&gt;
   0: Dir | CFT/ d:11 f:12
   1: a   | 1
   2: b   | 2
</pre>
<p>
	The necessary control over parsing requires this to be a global expression, not a
	member function (in ObjGlobal or elsewhere).
</p>


<h3>v1.9.10 2020-11-05 Added Process.data</h3>
<p>
	This function returns the context data Dict supplied in the original SpawnProcess()
	call.
</p>
<p>
	Updated Doc with comprehensive example for pinging multiple hosts in parallel.
</p>


<h3>v1.9.9 2020-11-04 Process exception handling</h3>
<p>
	If a process terminates with exception, add the full exception log to the
	virtual stdout of the process.
</p>
<p>
	Also verified there is NO invalid direct use of System.out throughout the code.
</p>
<p>
	Added Process.wait() function, which waits until process terminates, and returns self.
	This makes it easy to validate error handling, for example:
</p>
<pre>
	$ SpawnProcess(Dict,xxx).wait.output
 &lt;List&gt;
   0: Process fails with Exception: [input:19] unknown symbol 'xxx'
   1:    rf.configtool.data.LookupOrCall.resolve(LookupOrCall.java:80)
   2:    rf.configtool.data.ExprTerminal.resolve(ExprTerminal.java:177)
   3:    rf.configtool.data.ExprE.resolve(ExprE.java:40)
   4:    rf.configtool.data.ExprD.resolve(ExprD.java:55)
   5:    rf.configtool.data.ExprC.resolve(ExprC.java:54)
   6:    rf.configtool.data.ExprB.resolve(ExprB.java:51)
   7:    rf.configtool.data.ExprA.resolve(ExprA.java:50)
   8:    rf.configtool.data.Expr.resolve(Expr.java:62)
   9:    rf.configtool.main.runtime.lib.ObjProcess$Runner.run(ObjProcess.java:148)
  10:    java.base/java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:832)
</pre>
<p>
	Updated doc with example of using wait to collect data from set of processes.
</p>

<h3>v1.9.8 2020-11-03 Obj.clone + SpawnProcess()</h3>
<p>
	Created java function createClone() in the Obj class, and wrapped it as CFT function .clone(),
	which gets inherited by all Obj and Value objects. It works for synthesizable values by
	creating a synthesis string, then executing it, getting a perfect copy.  
</p>
<p>
	Renaming StmtSpawn to ExprSpawnProcess, and the CFT name to SpawnProcess.
</p>
<p>
	Added call to the ObjProcess start() method, which is called by ExprSpawnProcess, to convert the
	content of the Dict parameter to spawn() to the running context of the expression to 
	execute inside the Process. 
</p>
<p>
	Proof of concept
</p>
<pre>
Lib.Data.each(0,3)-&gt;x
	list=List(1,2)
	 
	Dict
		.set("list",list)
		.set("x",x)
		=&gt; data
	SpawnProcess(data, Inner{
		list.add(x)
		println("x=" + x)
		list-&gt;e println("list: " + e)
	}) =&gt; proc
	
	out(proc)
| _=>list
	Sys.sleep(1000)
	list-&gt;x
		println("------")
		x.output->line println(line)
/t
</pre>
<p>
	Tested blocking on input: ok
</p>
<pre>
# test 2̈́
# -
	data = Dict.set("a",1)
	process = SpawnProcess(data,Inner{
		println("Process running")
		x=readLine("Enter number").parseInt
		println("Adding one: " + (x+1))
		# return value
		"goodbye"		
	})

	Sys.sleep(500)
	process.output-&gt;line println("OUTPUT&gt; " + line) |
	line = readLine("Enter line to send to the process")
	process.sendLine(line)
	readLine("Enter to continue reading output from process")
	process.output-&gt;line println("OUTPUT&gt; " + line) |
	println("exitValue: " + process.exitValue)
/t2	


$ t2
OUTPUT&gt; Process running
OUTPUT&gt; (?) Enter number
(?) Enter line to send to the process
33
(?) Enter to continue reading output from process

OUTPUT&gt; Adding one: 34

<h3>v1.9.7 2020-11-03 Stdio</h3>
<p>
	Made Stdio class into an abstract, and created StdioReal and StdioVirtual.
</p>
<p>
	Also added ObjProcess and modified StmtSpawn, but it's not right yet. Still, everything seems to
	work like before. Tagget v1.9.6 at github before checking in this, as a fallback just in case.
</p>


<h2 class="tag">2020-11-02 Tagging v1.9.6</h3> 




<h3>v1.9.6 2020-11-02 Db2Obj script</h3>
<p>
	Added Lib.Db.Db2.collections function. Updated Db2 script.
</p>
<p>
	Created object oriented database, where data are wrapped in a Dict with date and
	a UUID, with a find function using a lambda / closure.
</p>
<p>
	Added Dict.getMany, which takes a list of keys, and returns a list of values, with
	null for missing values.
</p>
<p>
	Modified report() so that if it has one parameter, and its a list, it formats the
	content of that list.
</p>



<h3>v1.9.5 2020-11-02 Lib.Db.Db2</h3>
<p>
	Moved Db2 from Lib to new object/function Lib.Db. Updated the "Db2" script.
</p>
<p>
	Added Lib.Db.UUID function
</p>

<h3>v1.9.4 2020-11-01 spawn()</h3>
<p>
	Added global statement spawn() which takes an expression as parameter, and executes it
	in a separate thread. No return value as of now.
</p>
<pre>
List(1,2,3,4)-&gt;x 
	spawn({
		Sys.sleep(2000)
		println("hello"+x)
	})
/t


Test $ t
  &lt;List&gt;
  (empty)
Test $ hello2
hello4
hello1
hello3
</pre>
<p>
	When Hosts script has been rewritten, its goodbye to Val() and ValDef(). Must presumably also
	do something about Stdio class, and even create a Process-type for these threads.
</p>
<p>
	Done a temporary fix on the Stdio object, making every method synchronized. The long term
	solution is creating individual Stdio instances for each thread, and store it inside the
	Ctx object, hiding the one accessed via ObjGlobal. These instances must properly block on reads,
	and be made available via some Process type.
</p>
<p>
	Renamed return object from Dir.runProcess from "Process" to "ExtProcess". That leaves the Process
	type free for spawn().
</p>
<p>
	Removed Val() and ValDef() from ObjGlobal, as well as from Doc, added text on Db2.
</p>



<h3>v1.9.3 2020-11-01 Val() and ValDef()</h3>
<p>
	Rewritten all code except Hosts script to use Db2 instead of Val() and ValDef(), as
	these will be removed from CFT. The aim is to make the CFT as functional as 
	possible.
</p>


<h3>v1.9.2 2020-11-01 Lib.Db2</h3>
<p>
	Implemented Lib.Db2 database, which connects to thread-safe memory database written
	in Java, persisting to files.
</p>
<p>
	Changed script Db2 to use Lib.Db2 for Set, Get and Keys
</p>


<h3>v1.9.1 2020-11-01 ObjPersistent synchronized</h3>
<p>
	Only two objects extend ObjPeristent: Input and ObjLineReader
</p>
<p>
	Fixed.
</p>


<h2>v1.9.0 2020-11-01 Working towards parallelizing CFT</h2>
<p>
	Looping and PIPE are forbidden inside local blocks, and will result in errors.
</p>




<h3>v1.8.1 2020-10-26 minor adjustments</h3>
<p>
	Renamed SoftException to SoftErrorException
</p>
<p>
	Added check in CondSequence that first parameter resolves to a boolean.
</p>

<p>
	Extended Val() function to take optional default value, which is stored
	if no value found, plus returned.
</p>

<p>
	Dir.create returns self, and throws Exception if failing to create dir
</p>

<p>
	Dict.mergeCodes now optionally takes two parameters, pre and post, which
	if not given, default to "${" and "}" as before.
</p>

<h2>v1.8.0 2020-10-25 java class SoftException</h2>
<p>
	Differing errors into hard and soft.
</p>
</p>
	Created Java class SoftException, and letting global function error() throw 
	SoftException instead of Exception. Created tryCatchSoft() to detect these,
	while passing hard exceptions on, to be caught by tryCatch() or the runtime
	system. 
</p>
<pre>
  tryCatchSoft ()
  ---------------
  ok: true
  result: ANY

  or

  ok: false
  msg: string

  tryCatch ()
  -----------
  ok: true
  result: ANY

  or 

  ok: false
  msg: string
  stack: List of string
</pre>




<h3>v1.7.6 2020-10-25 loop variables</h3>
<p>
	Assigning values to loop variables is forbidden, and now I've added code that
	generates an error if attempted.
</p>

<h3>v1.7.6 2020-10-25 if-expr</h3>
<p>
	After modifying the if-expression into two forms, the (original) inline format and
	the traditional form, the use of expressions only has become a problem:
</p>
<pre>
	# inline form
	if (cond, expr, expr)            # feels natural

	# traditional form
	if (cond) expr [else expr]       # this causes problems
</pre>
<p>
	The problem is that in order to do common things like assigning a variable, or 
	break current loop, the code had to be put inside a block, since blocks are
	expressions that may contain statements.
</p>
<pre>
	if (x>a) {a=x}
	if (x>a) {break}
</pre>
<p>
	This has now been fixed, by letting the if expression look for expressions when
	inline form, and statements in traditional form:
</p>
<pre>
	if (x>a) a=x
	if (x>a) break
</pre>


<h3>v1.7.5 2020-10-24 List.first</h3>
<p>
	Added List.first, working like List.last, both differing from List.nth
	in that they don't produce errors when list is empty or contains too 
	few elements.
</p>


<h3>v1.7.5 2020-10-24 Doc and Readme updated</h3>


<h3>v1.7.5 2020-10-24 Dir.runProcessWait deleted</h3>
<p>
	After introducing the Process return object from Dir.runProcess, the
	runProcessWait() function became redundant.
</p>

<h3>v1.7.5 2020-10-24 Lib.Text.Parser deleted</h3>
<p>
	The skeleton code for Parser has been deleted, as writing a recursive descent
	parser in CFT was rather easy. May want to have another go at processing
	full grammars, but retired the code for now.
</p>



<h3>v1.7.5 2020-10-24 Lib:runProcess</h3>
<p>
	Wrote new function for Lib script, which has same call interface as Lib:run, but runs
	external program in background, and manage it via the new Process object, as well
	as the Dict as object mechanism.
</p>
<p>
	As most of the code came from Lib:run, and as the new code tested ok, Lib:run is now
	implemented by calling Lib:runProcess and then calling the "wait" closure in the
	intermediate Dict object. The call signature of Lib:run is unchanged.
</p>
<p>
	Considering that Dir.runProcess was a hack to fork off Node processes to populate
	MongoDB, with no regard for what happened after, other than regularly reading the stdout
	file to generate statistics, and left to terminate or be killed from the OS, the
	humble Dir.runProcess has come a long way.
</p>



<h3>v1.7.5 2020-10-24 Dict as object</h3>
<p>
	Improved the "primitive objects" implementation by letting Dict.set
	detect Lambdas and wrapping them inside Closures, with current dict
	becoming the "self" object
</p>
<pre>
	Dict
		.set("a",Lambda{self.b.call}) 
		.set("b",Lambda{"this is b"})
		=> x
	x.a.call

	# results in "this is b"
</pre>
<p>
	Further, we also let Dict.set detect Closures, extracting the Lambda
	and rewrapping in new Closure, with current Dict as "self". This means
	obtaining a lambda (really a closure) from one Dict, and storing it
	in another, a new closure is created, so calling it via the new Dict
	means "self" points to it, and not the original Dict.
</p>
<pre>

<h3>v1.7.4 2020-10-22 Lib.Text</h3>
<p>
	Added code to the TokenStream object, to use for parsing JSON
</p>
<p>
	Created first (experimental) JSON parser in CFT, saved under code.examples
</p>


<h3>v1.7.3 2020-10-22 Process object</h3>
<p>
	Modified Dir.runProcess to return a Process object, with functions to 
	detect if process is still alive, obtain its exit code, and destroy it.
</p>
<pre>
# test
	stdin  = Lib:TmpFile("in")
	stdout = Lib:TmpFile("out")
	stderr = Lib:TmpFile("err")

	stdin.create("")
	
	process=Dir.runProcess(stdin,stdout,stderr,"ps -efal".split)
	loop
		println("Waiting")
		Sys.sleep(1)
		break(!process.isAlive)
	|
	println("exitCode=" + process.exitCode)
	stdin.delete
	if(stdout.exists) stdout.delete
	if(stderr.exists) stderr.delete
/t
</pre>

<h3>v1.7.2 2020-10-20 Extend interactive '?' function</h3>
<pre>
	$ ?              show all functions
	$ ?x             show functions x*
	$ ?s:            show all functions in script s
	$ ?s:y           show functions x* in script s
</pre>
<p>
	Also extended List.last() function to take optional count.
</p>
<p>
	Extended comment on PS:Call function, on how to invoke cmd functions like "dir".
</p>

<h3>v1.7.1 2020-10-20 Added -d startup option</h3>
<p>
	Added support for setting custom script directory, with
</p>
<pre>
	./cft -d someDir ...
</pre>
<p>
	Also added support for -help
</p>
<pre>
  ./cft
  ./cft scriptName [commandLines]*
  ./cft -version
  ./cft -help
  ./cft -d scriptDir [scriptName [commandLines]*]?
</pre>

<h2>v1.7.0 2020-10-17 Templating improvement</h2>
<p>
	Added expressions Sequence and CondSequence, which are used to create
	lists, in compact format, and also with separating comma optional.
</p>
<pre>
	Sequence(1,2)+CondSequence(false 3 4)+CondSequence(true 5 6)
	&lt;List&gt;
	1
	2
	5
	6
</pre>

<p>
	Added "RAW" string type, using '@' and extending to end of line. Not particularly suited
	for interactive use, but great for templates. 
</p>
<pre>
	lines = Sequence(
		@ bind:
		@   all
	)+CondSequence(isAlive,
		@ alive:
		@   true
	)+Sequence(
		@ over:
		@   and out
	)
</pre>
<p>
	Lines starting with '@' + space, have the "@ " sequence removed from the start of the line.
	Lines starting with '@@' have that sequence removed from the start of the line.
	For other cases, only the single '@' is stripped.
</p>
<p>
	This is an alternative to the "here" documents using &lt;&lt;&lt; EOF marks, for
	both greater readability, as the text lines can be properly indented, and flexibility
	with conditional sequences of lines.
</p>
<p>
	To test from command line, remember that by default '@' indicates a shortcut.
</p>
<pre>
	$ "" + @ this is a test
	&lt;String&gt;
	this is a test
</pre>





<h3>v1.6.1 2020-10-02</h3>
<p>
	Fixed '?xxx' command so that if exact match, show code, then check for startsWith().
</p>
<p>
	Improved Investigate script with support for topics, so that log files
	are properly named.
</p>

<h2>v1.6.0 2020-10-02 changed syntax for calling function in other script</h2>
<p>
	Added simplified call syntax for calling code in other scripts. 
</p>
<pre>
	call "Script:Function" (...) 

	now is written as

	Script:Function (...)
</pre>
<p>
	Modified all scripts.
</p>


<h3>v1.5.5 2020-10-02</h3>

<p>
	Modified Db script (under code.lib), adding function GUI() to maintain
	data in collection manually, as well as inspect content.
</p>


<h2 class="tag">2020-10-02 Tagging v1.5.4</h3> 


<h3>v1.5.4 2020-09-30 Various changes</h3>
<p>
	Changed return value for Dir.runProcessWait() from self to the exit-code. This makes the function
	thread-safe, in that there is no need to call Sys.lastEPS.
</p>

<p>
	Removing Sys.lastEPS and Sys.lastEPSData as this is an ugly hack. Except for
	ad hoc or interactive runs, for reliability, should always use runProcessWait(),
	as it returns exit code.
</p>
<p>
	Creating a function "Lib:run" that returns Dict, and changing SSH:run to use it,
	adding output filtering on top.
</p>

<p>
	Renamed function Sys.tryUnsafe() to the more logical tryCatch()
	Changed in scripts as well. A useful fu
</p>

<p>
	Added function Dir.setAsCurrentDir to programmatically set working directory.
</p>

<p>
	Various fixes in scripts as a consequence of the above changes, including getting
	MongoHA scrip
</p>


<h3>v1.5.3 2020-09-28 Added start parameter -version</h3>
<p>
	When managing multiple installs automatically, it is nice to
	be able to produce the version string easily.
</p>



<h3>v1.5.2 2020-09-28 Added global function tryUnsafe(expr)</h3>
<p>
	Implemented as global expression ExprTryUnsafe(). Returns Dict
	with fields result, msg, ok, stack, populated according
	to outcome.
</p>



<h3>v1.5.1 2020-09-26 Added global function getType()</h3>
<p>
	Having system libraries use x.?nth to check if x is a list, only works
	if x is a non-empty list. Easier to create one global function that returns the
	same string that is displayed interactively for every result value.
</p>
<pre>
	if (!getType(x)=="List") ...
</pre>

<h2>v1.5.0 2020-09-22 Assignment change</h2>
<pre>
	$ 3=a    # NOW INVALID
	$ 3=>a   # OK
	$ a=3    # OK
</pre>


<h3>v1.4.0 2020-09-15 Lib.Text.Parser</h3>
<p>
	Changed Node.setIsToken() so that tokenType is optional, and defaults to 0, because
	when using the Parser, we often will not care about type, only match / non-match.
</p>
<p>	
	Added Lib.Text.Lexer.Node.addTokenComplex function
</p>

<pre>
Lib.Text.Lexer.Node =date
date.addTokenComplex("iiii-ii-ii", Dict.set("i","0123456789")).setIsToken
</pre>


<h3>v1.3.3 2020-09-14 Lib.Text.Parser</h3>
<p>
	Have by now mostly figured out how the Parser should behave. For CFT we process the complete
	script file (or input line) into tokens first, then run recursive-descent parsing, coded
	in Java, with objects creating objects recursively. The CFT parser uses a lookahead of 1, and
	does not backtrack (the Lexer does).
</p>
<p>
	Creating a generic parser that will be used for both structured data such as JSON or HTML, 
	and processing log-lines with potentially complex and overlapping token definitions, this parser 
	will need to do backtracking. This means lookahead none, supporting multiple productions
	per non-terminal symbol.
</p>
<p>
	The "productions" scheme for grammar representation is inspired by EBNF, which is
	the Extended Backus-Naur Form. which evidently extended BNF by allowing '?', '*' and '+'
	modifiers in the grammar, saving lots of problematic (potentially infinite) recursion.
</p>
<p>
	I've made a further extension in the same direction, allowing not only the above modifiers,
	but for '*' and '+' also allowing reference to a second separator non-terminal that has to
	be matched inbetween repeating instances of the first non-terminal. It complicates the
	implementation a bit, but greatly simplifies the grammar.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Created Lib.Text.Parser object</li>
	<li>Created Parser.readme</li>
	<li>Created Parser.production (just validates parameters)</li>
	<li>Fixed String.sub from (start,count) to (start,end)</li>
	<li>Checked Lib code: String.sub is never used</li>
</ul>



<h3>v1.3.2 2020-09-13 Lib.Text.Lexer</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Removed Identifier and LPAR, RPAR.</li>
	<li>Renamed function Empty() to Node().</li>
	<li>Added required integer token type parameter to LexerNode.setIsToken().</li>
	<li>Created ObjLexerToken class.</li>
	<li>Created ObjLexer.processLine, which adds tokens to internal list</li>
	<li>Created ObjLexer.getTokens and .getTokenStream to get tokens.</li>
	<li>The processLine function detects if lines were read from file, and
	supplies file name and line number into the source location of tokens.
	</li>
	<li>Created ObjLexerTokenStream class, but its functionality is not clear yet.</li>
	<li>Tested and updated doc</li>
</ul>




<h3>v1.3.1 2020-09-12 Created Dict.invoke</h3>
<p>
	Storing data and lambdas in a Dict, and invoking a lambda via Dict.invoke,
	we have simple objects, as the Dict.invoke calls the lambda with itself
	as the "self" value.
</p>
<h4>Test code</h4>

<pre>
# Creating Dict with data and lambda, calling lambda, inspecting data change
# Also illustrates lambdas calling each other, via the "self" variable.
	Dict
		.set("i",1)
		.set("incr",Lambda{
			self.get("i")+P(1,1) =x 
			self.set("i",x) 
		})
		.set("plus50",Lambda{
			self.invoke("incr",50)
		})
		=data
	
	data.invoke("incr",2)
	println("result=" + data.i)  # 3
	data.invoke("plus50")
	println("result=" + data.i)  # 53
/test2
</pre>


<h3>v1.3.1 2020-09-12 Created Closure</h3>
<p>
	A closure is created by binding a Lambda to a dictionary. It has 
	a .call() function just like a Lambda. When run, the Lambda accesses
	the dictionary via the "self" variable. 
</p>
<p>
	The implementation assures even when a Lambda is invoked directly, 
	not via a Closure object, 
	then the variable "self" points to an empty Dict object.
</p>
<pre>
	# this means that
	Lambda{self}.call
	# returns an empty Dict
</pre>
<h4>
	Initial test code.
</h4>

<pre>
# Function called with Lambda, which in turn gets called on certain condition
	P(1,Lambda{P(1)}) =eventHandler

	readLine("generate event (enter for none)") =val
	if (val != "") {
		eventHandler.call(val)
	}
/eventGenerator



# Function setting up empty data Dict, and Lambda, creating Closure, calling eventGenerator, then reporting result
	Dict =data
	Lambda{
		self.set("value",P(1))
	} =event
	data.bind(event) =closure
	
	event.call("x")  # not invoked via closure - should not access same Dict
	
	eventGenerator(closure)
	if(data.has("value")) {
	  println("event was called: " + data.get("value"))
	} else {
	  println("No event")
	}
/test

<h2 class="tag">2020-09-12 Tagging v1.3.0</h3> 


<h2>v1.3.0 branch</h2>
<ol>
	<li><b>v1.3.0</b><br/>
	Changed ExprIf from if(cond,a,b) to ?(cond,a,b) and ?(cond,a) eliminating ExprWhen. Converted
	all script code.
</li><li><b>v1.3.0 (b)</b><br/>
	Changed {* ...} blocks to "Lambda {...}" and {...} to "Inner {...}". Converted all script code and
	tested.
</li><li><b>v1.3.0 (c)</b><br/>
	Reverted ?(...) to if(...), and currently mapping both if and when to ExprIf.<br/>
	Also extended parsing of ExprIf to handle two forms: if(expr,expr[,expr]) and if(expr) expr [else expr]
</li><li><b>v1.3.0 (d)</b><br/>
	Renamed ExprMacro to ExprBlock, and ValueMacro to ValueBlock.<br/>
	Added support for three modes: INNER, LAMBDA and LOCAL. Currently
	LOCAL equals INNER, just to get the syntax tested.
</li><li><b>v1.3.0 (e)</b><br/>
	Implemented local block, which is {...} and runs in same context, similar to statements outside the
	block. <br/>
	Looping inside a local block may cause strange effects, as it shares out-data with its
	containing environment. There is nothing preventing use of loops inside local blocks, but it is
	better to do so inside Inner blocks. 

</li><li><b>v1.3.0 (f)</b><br/>
	Modified assert(), reject() and break() to propagate up to first ctx marked with containing a loop.
	See Ctx.setAbortIterationFlag() and .setBreakLoopFlag() 
	<br/>
	Then did some testing, which is included here, as it is useful for understanding how loops
	are controlled, see below. 
	<br/>
	But the following works now:
	<br/>
	loop if(cond) {break(true)}
	<br/>
	Ditto for assert(cond) and reject(cond).
	<br/>
	Changed break to be both unconditional (no params) and conditional. 
	<br/>
	Changed global function error(cond, msg) to make condition optional.
</li></ol>

</p>



<h3>v1.2.2 2020-09-06</h3>
<p>
	Improved Hosts script, allowing wildchars. Added file logging for APTUpdate script when failing.
	Added functions CheckSSHKeys and UpdateAPT to Hosts script.
</p>
<p>
	Created Lib function DirPrivate, which replaces direct naming of Sys.homeDir around the code.
</p>
<p>
	Removed log message saying "directory exists" when trying to create a dir that exists.
</p>




<h3>v1.2.1 2020-09-04</h3>
<p>
	Fixed parsing of floats. Made Lib script a bit more robust with regards to "private" directory.
</p>

<h2>v1.2.0 2020-09-03</h2>
<p>
	Added Lib.Text.Lexer functionality, to enable advanced matching of strings. Built on the internal
	rf.configtool.parser.CharSet implementation. Made in preparation for (recursive-descent) line parser 
	implementation, for full logfile processing, etc.
</p>
<p>
	Lib.Text.Lexer functions:
</p>
<pre>
	Test $ Lib.Text.Lexer help
  # Empty(firstChars?) - create Empty node, possibly identifying firstChars list
  # Identifier() - create Identifier node

</p>

<h3>v1.1.13 2020-08-29</h3>
<p>
	Moved SSH script file from code.examples to code.lib. Various script cleanup.
</p>

	home directory. Breaking logs into files named by date. Adjusted ".gitignore". Removed file
	reference to ".investigate" (old log file in home dir) from Release script.
</p>
<p>
	- Added Dir.unprotect() and File.unprotect(). These require the dir or file to be protected,
	otherwise throwing exception, as these are not to be used routinely.
</p>

	created function Sys.lastEPSData() which returns Dict or null if undefined.
</p>
<p>
	Implemented for Dir.run() and Dir.runCapture(), plus Dir.runProcessWait()
</p>


<h3>v1.1.6b 2020-08-19 Added Lib.Exp.onCtxClose(macro)</h3>
<p>
	Mostly for testing, but might be nice to have if creating return() statement, acts like
	a finally in Java, except only when no exception ....
</p>
<p>
	Hmm, that's a thing to consider, 
	being able to ensure the code runs even when errors. 
</p>

<h3>v1.1.6b 2020-08-19 Added object Lib.Exp</h3>
<p>
	Created Lib.Exp function/object for experimental code. 
</p>

<p>
	Added function that matches single line, for use with LineReader etc
</p>

<h3>v1.1.5c 2020-08-08 Bugfix previous change</h3>

	updated Doc.html.
</p>

<h2 class="tag">2020-08-06 Tagging v1.1.4</h3> 


<h3>v1.1.4 2020-08-06 Lib.LogFiles.LineReader</h3>
<p>
	Created LineReader function and persistent object, for reading lines from a file.
</p>
<p>
	Every time the LineReader() function is invoked for the same file object, it
	is reset to start reading from first line.
</p>


<h3>v1.1.4 2020-08-06 Lib.LogFiles / moved DateSort</h3>
<p>
	Created Lib.LogFiles and moved DateSort into it.
</p>

<h3>v1.1.4 2020-08-05 MongoHA</h3>
<p>
	Added support for a prefix to all host names, so that mcfg1, mcfg2, mcfg3 and so on becomes
	bmcfg1, bmcfg2, ... if prefix is "b". Creating VM's with these names and separate IP-addresses,
	lets us configure multiple MongoDB HA enviroments with the same script.
</p>

<h3>v1.1.4 2020-08-05 Scripts</h3>
<p>
	Added functions to ServersMaintenance to set /etc/hostname and configure /etc/netplan
	for VM's. Added code to the KVM Clone() function to use these, so that it now configures
	the newly created clone then reboots it. 
</p>
<p>
	This means there is no need as such to install CFT on the clone template VM, as
	all initial setup is managed from the outside. The VM script is becoming obsolete.
</p>

<h3>v1.1.4 2020-08-03 Doc</h3>
<p>
	Had to add a section "Fun and strange stuff", since there are a bit of those.


<h2 class="tag">2020-08-03 Tagging v1.1.3</h3> 


<h3>v1.1.3 2020-08-03 various</h3>
<p>
 	- Lib script: Improved menu selection to prefer exact match if possible.
</p>
<p>
	- Created MongoHA script which installs mongodb, mongo shell and mongos on servers in a
	HA configuration (EXPERIMENTAL)
</p>
<p>
	- Created Systemd script, with a function CreateService, called from MongoHA for setting
	up mongos as a service (EXPERIMENTAL)
</p>
<p>
	- Changed syntax for inline lists of text, so that one may use any number 
	of '&lt;' or '&gt;' as long as there as at least three, followed by a space and
	the identifier. This means it gets easier to see the inline text beginning and end.
</p>
<pre>
	&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; EOF
	this is
	some text
	&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; EOF
</pre>
<p>
	- Added Dict.hasNullValue() function. Using it to detect if result from PDict() contains
	unmatched parameters.
</p>
<p>
	- Upgraded the Investigate script from experimental to normal, as it is now considered
	useful (and has been used for several days). 
</p>

<h3>v1.1.3 2020-08-02 KVM script</h3>
<p>
	Updated documentation (Readme function).
</p>

<h3>v1.1.3 2020-08-02 :sw</h3>
<p>
	Fixed :sw so that exact match overrides partial match when switching to different
	script.
</p>

<h3>v1.1.3 2020-08-02 DateSort.search()</h3>
<p>
	Created DateFormat.search to locate lines between date/time intervals in log files where lines
	start with date/time. It uses binary search internally, to locate start-point to read from,
	with random access reads. Should be fast even for huge log files.
</p>
<p>
	Example
</p>
<pre>
	Dir(...).protect
	/LogDir

	# Show log lines for 10 minutes
	Input("Date YYYY-MM-DD").get=d
	Input("Time HH:MM:SS").get=t
	Date.parse(d+" "+t).get =startTimeMs
	LogDir.files-&gt;f
		DateSort.search(f,startTimeMs,startTimeMs+10*60*1000)-&gt;line 
			out(line)
	| _=allLines
	DateSort.asc(allLines)
	/Search
</pre>


<h3>v1.1.3 2020-08-01 File.tail</h3>
<p>
	Using RandomAccessFile, calculating a likely offset from end of file. This is done via
	an assumed max line length (in bytes), which defaults to 256. This means the 
	tail() function uses same amount of
	time regardless of file size. If lines are on average longer, then fewer lines will be
	returned.
</p>

<h2 class="tag">2020-08-01 Tagging v1.1.2</h3>


<h3>v1.1.2 2020-08-01 root input loop</h3>
<p>
	Added logic so that input loop displays prompt only when no buffered input lines, as
	with Input.get and readLine()
</p>

<h3>v1.1.2 2020-08-01 SSH script</h3>
<p>
	Improved SSH script so that it creates target .ssh directory if it doesn't exist.
</p>

<h3>v1.1.2 2020-07-31 Doc update</h3>
<p>
	Included the .protect feature earlier, and reorganized a bit
</p>

<h3>v1.1.2 2020-07-31 File.protect / Dir.protect</h3>
<p>
	Made parameter optional, calling it desc instead of "code".
</p>


<h3>v1.1.2 2020-07-31 Improved Investigation script</h3>
<p>
	Standardized file output. Changed shortcuts to lower case.
</p>


<h3>v1.1.2 2020-07-31 Logical bug</h3>
<p>
	!a && !b  failed
</p>
<p>
	Seemed to end up as !(a && !(b)) due to indiscriminate Expr matching. 
</p>
<p>
	Fixed in ExprTerminal, where notExpr is now ExprE instead of Expr. Verified by simple
	truth table listout.
</p>
<pre>
a=true b=true false
a=true b=false false
a=false b=true false
a=false b=false true
</pre>

<h3>v1.1.2 2020-07-31 Colon command overhaul</h3>
<p>
	Improved feedback when typing just ":"
</p>
<p>
	Added :sw which switches between loaded scripts by partial match, or lists all
	available if no (partial) identifier given
</p>


<h3>v1.1.2 2020-07-27 Doc overhaul</h3>
<p>
	Replaced old term "code blocks" with "loop spaces", leaving "block expressions" and macros
	unchanged.
</p>


<h2 class="tag">2020-07-27 Tagging v1.1.1</h3>


<h3>v1.1.1 2020-07-27 created Sys.uptime</h3>
<p>
	Just for fun.
</p>
<p>
	Also fixed some "errror" messages (typos).
</p>


<h3>v1.1.1 2020-07-24 created PropsFile prompt code field</h3>
<p>
	Added code to CFT.props:

	prompt = Sys.scriptName=x if(x==null,"$ ",x+" $ ")
</p>

<h3>v1.1.1 2020-07-24 created Sys.scriptName</h3>
<p>
	Returns script name only - used by prompt script
</p>

<h3>v1.1.1 2020-07-24 moved savefile() to Sys.savefile()</h3>
<p>
	Also makes it return null when not defined, instead of error. Modified the @e shortcut accordingly.
</p>


<h3>v1.1.1 2020-07-24 moved isWindows to Sys.isWindows()</h3>
<p>
	Cleaning up global namespace
</p>

<h3>v1.1.1 2020-07-23 Error handling</h3>
<p>
	Created SourceException which improves error handling, by wrapping non-SourceExceptions into
	SourceExceptions at certain points, getting an indication about where the error occurred also
	for exceptions from inside java libraries, such as trying to read a file that doesn't exist.
</p>


<h3>v1.1.1 2020-07-23 Moved stdin() to Sys.stdin()</h3>
<p>
	The global statement stdin() is now function stdin() inside Sys object, in an effort
	to clear up global name space, and stdin is a natural name for a file parameter
	to Dir.runProcess* functions.
</p>


<h3>v1.1.1 2020-07-22 ServersMaintenance script</h3>
<p>
	Improved this script with new function RemoteCommandSetCoded() to easily categorize
	output from ssh session. The RemoteCommandSet function is improved as well, 
	echoing a marker string, and looking for it in stdout, to eliminate the
	welcome text when logging in. It also returns stderr lines, prefixing output
	lines with (stdout) or (stderr).
</p>


<h3>v1.1.1 2020-07-22 File.tail and .head</h3>
<p>
	Added File.head, and modified File.tail, so both return empty list
	if file doesn't exist, rather than exception.
</p>

<h3>v1.1.1 2020-07-21 Dir.runProcessWait timeout</h3>
<p>
	Added 5 minutes timeout
</p>


<h3>v1.1.1 2020-07-21 Dir.runProcessWait</h3>
<p>
	Functions like .runProcess() but waits for process to terminate. Dir.runProcess() was written
	for a case where we wanted to run up to 100 background node processes, for stress testing. 
	That is a valid use case, so leaving it unmodified, creating new function instead.
</p>


<h2 class="tag">2020-07-21 Tagging v1.1</h3>

<h3>v1.1.0 2020-07-21 P(N,Expr)</h3>
<p>
	Made resolving optional default-value Expr lazy, so only resolved when needed. This allows us to put
	interactive code as default, asking for the value, and saves us a "when (value==null, ...)"
	in the code.
</p>
<pre>
P(1,Input("Enter value").get) =value
</pre>

<h3>v1.1.0 2020-07-21 ServersMaintenance script</h3>
<p>
	Created script for automating apt-get update etc, on a number of hosts, based on
	SSH script for key based ssh (no password) plus adding to /etc/sudoers for
	password-less sudo command. See Readme in SSH script.
</p>
<p>
	Also added @SM shortcut for ServersMaintenance script.
</p>

<h3>v1.1.0 2020-07-21 Sys.sleep(millis)</h3>
<p>
	Added this to enable waiting for completion of external processes
</p>


<h3>v1.1.0 2020-07-21 SSH script</h3>
<p>
	Created script for distributing ssh key to various hosts, for password free login
</p>


<h3>v1.1.0 2020-07-20 Projects script</h3>
<p>
	Improved Projects script message when projects.txt file missing
</p>

<h3>v1.1.0 2020-07-20 debug mode / KVM</h3>
<p>
	Extended the :debug mode into the code, currently logging the source-location of
	each statement and Expr as it gets executed, and used this to find bug in KVM script.
</p>

<h2 class="tag">2020-07-19 Tagging v1.0.17</h3>
<pre>
v1.0.17 is now frozen. Next version is v1.1. 
Changes since v1.0:

	- cd/ls/edit/more 
	- error() function
	- when() expression
	- macros / block expressions
	- Root class handles multiple ObjGlobal 
	- full functionality in macros
	- CFT.props file / source dirs 
	- shell command
	- Dir and File protect
	- symlink awareness, though not fully handled
	- Grep memory use / limits / .fileCount
	- Lib script improvements / terminal size
	- Sys.lastResult / Investigate script (early version)
	- general Projects script
	- shortcuts, particularly @e freeing up symbol 'e' from all scripts

	- various bugs and improvements
</pre>




<h3>v1.0.17 2020-07-18 terminal size</h3>
<p>
	Added shortcut @term to check size of terminal. Had to move the ObjCfg instance from
	ObjGlobal to Root. 
</p>
<p>
	Changed Lib.m() to use system more on Windows as well.
</p>




<h3>v1.0.17 2020-07-18 shortcuts</h3>
<p>
	Added shortcuts feature. Consists of config lines in CFT.props, and handling in
	Root.processInteractiveInput.
</p>

<p>
	Example from CFT.props
</p>
<pre>
# Shortcuts
#
# The shortcuts are lines of code. If that code results in a macro, it is invoked with
# no parameters. Since we don't need parameters, there is really no need for macros
# here. The return value from a shortcut becomes the "last value", available
# via Sys.lastResult, as well as used by :syn etc
#
# Note that shortcuts only work when the prefix is at the start of the interactive
# input line. 
# ---
shortcutPrefix = @

shortcut:r = stdin(":load Release","?")
shortcut:p = stdin(":load Projects","?")

# List available shortcuts when typing '@' only
# ---
shortcut: = File("CFT.props").read-&gt;line assert(line.contains("shortcut:")) out(line)
</pre>
<p>
	This means typing @r on the comand line, loads "Release" script and lists its content
</p>
<p>
	Also moved PropsFile instance from ObjGlobal, which despite its name has multiple
	instances, into Root, which is the new single master object.
</p>
<p>
	And added autoload to PropsFile (called from top of Root.processInteractiveInput.
</p>
<p>
	Even implemented a default shortcut, when typing only @, which lists the shortcuts
	by searching the CFT.props file!!
</p>



<h3>v1.0.17 2020-07-17 Sys.lastResult()</h3>
<p>
	Created Sys.lastResult() function, that returns the last result as stored inside Root, 
	from previous interactive command.
</p>


<h3>v1.0.17 2020-07-17 :new</h3>
<p>
	Created new colon command "new", to create new empty script and set it as current.
</p>

<h3>v1.0.17 2020-07-17 Projects script</h3>
<p>
	Improved Projects script, making file name filtering more explicitly set and cleared.
</p>
<p>
	Removed CRLF
</p>
<pre>
$ :load Projects
$ savefile.read=x savefile.create(x)
</pre>

<h3>v1.0.17 2020-07-17 reload script bug</h3>
<p>
	Fixed minor bug, when deleting a script file that has been loaded, CFT crashed.
</p>


<h3>v1.0.17 2020-07-17 shell() function</h3>
<p>
	Added CFT.props field "winShell" set to "powershell" as default, 
	while keeping the "shell" field, and differentiating between windows and linux
	in the shell() function.
</p>	




<h2 class="tag">2020-07-17 Tagging v1.0.16</h3>


<h3>v1.0.16 2020-07-17 Issue #3</h3>
<p>
	Added Root class, which manages parallel ObjGlobal instances, as
	loaded with :load or when calling functions in other scripts. Handling of interactive
	commands is moved from Runtime to Root. Main and Runtime are both slimmed
	down.
</p>


<h3>v1.0.16 2020-07-15</h3>
<p>
	Created CONTRIBUTING.md file
</p>

<h3>v1.0.16 2020-07-14</h3>
<p>
	Changed Grep, removing .modeCheck and .modeCount, instead creating .fileCount(file)
	along with .file(file). 
</p>
<p>
	Also retiring the .lines() function. Grep is for files.
</p>
<p>
	Adding script Projects to examples, as well as (private) projects.txt
</p>
<p>
	Added DataFile.keys()
</p>
<p>
	Added code.example savefileProjects.txt which is a generic script for searching
	through different projects, as defined in file projects.txt under CFT home directory.
</p>

<h3>v1.0.16 2020-07-12</h3>
<p>
	Changed global error() function to take two parameters: boolean condition and message.
</p>
<p>
	Added newline for readLine. Added common prefix (?) to both readLine() and Input.get()
</p>
<o>
	Moved system messages from OutText to ObjGlobal, ensuring we can present them
	after all interactive processing is complete, for example when Grep.file() passes limits.
</o>

<p>
	Added function Sys.outCount() returning number of values emitted with out(), to do
	cutoffs for huge result sets.
</p>


<h3>v1.0.16 2020-07-11 Grep</h3>
<p>
	Fixed bug so that Grep.file() uses File.getEncoding()
</p>
<p>
	Improved handling of limit, so that if there is a limit, no more than that number of ValueObjFileLine
	are kept in memory at the time.
</p>
<p>
	Also applied a default corresponding to "limitFirst(1000)".
</p>
<p>
	Added Grep.modeCount() which changes .file() and .lines() to return number of matches instead
	of data.
</p>
<p>
	When doing regular search and reaching the limit, a WARNING is issued via the 
	OutText.addSystemMessage()
</p>


<h2 class="tag">2020-07-11 Tagging v1.0.15</h3>


<h3>v1.0.15 2020-07-10 File.encoding</h3>
<p>
	Merged File.setEncoding() into File.encoding, in order to limit number of functions. Tested synthesis ok. 
</p>


<h3>v1.0.15 2020-07-10 cleanup</h3>
<p>
	Cleaned up some scripts. Removed File.isSymLink() as there are getting many functions in File.
	A proper treatment of symlinks will require a separate class. For now, protecting symlink against
	destructive operations will have to do.
</p>

<h3>v1.0.15 2020-07-10 symlink detection</h3>
<p>
	Changed symlink restrictions into using the Protection object, and removed special
	handling for isSymlink(). Also added isSymlink() to Dir. Makes sense to maintain only
	one mechanism for blocking operations.
</p>


<h3>v1.0.15 2020-07-10 cat / edit / more</h3>

<p>
	Created class StmtCatEditMore as subclass of StmtShellInteractive, which implements these 
	three functions (as statements) via macros defined in CFT.props.
</p>
<p>
	Works perfectly. Makes it easy to customize key functionality.
</p>
<p>
	Deleted StmtCat standalone implementation from earlier, as this is a much
	more elegant (and fun) solution.
</p>


<h3>v1.0.15 2020-07-10 StmtShellInteractive</h3>
<p>
	Removed substring matching, now that globbing works as it should, as we're using same tokenizer 
	as for code. Example:
</p>
<pre>
	$ cat a.b
</pre>
<p>
	This is three tokens, "a", "." and "b", and so if there is no match on the concatenation "a.b", then
	doing substrings matching would look for file names containg a and dot and b. Not intuitive!
</p>
<p>
	Updated doc
</p>

<h3>v1.0.15 2020-07-10 File.tail(n)</h3>
<p>
	Added function to get n last lines of file.
</p>

<h3>v1.0.15 2020-07-10 Dir.protect() and File.protect()</h3>
<p>
	Protection is a property that can be set on a file or a directory. Any files and directories 
	derived from it, inherit the protection status. 
</p>
<p>
	A protected directory does not allow create, delete or copy file into dir. This includes blocking 
File.uncompress if target dir is protected.
</p>
<p>
A protected file does not allow delete, create, append, copyFrom (target), copyTo, move (source or target)
</p>




<h2 class="tag">2020-07-10 Tagging v1.0.14</h3>



<h3>v1.0.14 2020-07-09 - ls / cd / cat</h3>
<p>
	Implemented common parent class, StmtShellInteractive.java, for all shell functionality: 
	ls, cd, cat, edit, mkdir, rmdir, touch, rm
</p>
<p>
	Using existing parser still.
</p>
<p>
	Implemented and tested StmtLs, StmtCat, StmtCd
</p>

<h3>v1.0.14 2020-07-08 .runCapture</h3>
<p>
	Removed output to screen for Dir.runCapture()
</p>

<h3>2020-07-08 Lib e2()</h3>
<p>
	Created function e2() which edits a file from history. The history is persisted to file .editHistory
	in home directory. Done in preparation for global edit() command, which perhaps with no args
	can run the "Lib:e2" function.
</p>

<h3>v1.0.13 2020-07-07 Lib.Sys becomes just Sys (namespace)</h3>
<p>
	Renamed "Lib.Sys" into "Sys". Renamed function .sysMsg() to .log(). Moved global .codeDirs() inside.
</p>

<h3>v1.0.13 2020-07-06 shell()</h3>
<p>
	Added global function shell() and configuration field in props-file ("shell")
</p>

<h3>v1.0.12 2020-07-05 condOut()</h3>
<p>
	Like out() but with a conditional expression. For situations where assert/reject isn't suitable,
	for example we want to do more logic. Since out() is not an expression it can not be put inside
	an if() or when(), and also it can not be put inside a macro.
</p>

<h3>v1.0.11 2020-07-05 Props</h3>
<p>
	Added PropsFile class, which reads file "CFT.props". Configures only one field,
	codeDirs, which is a list of directories in sequence to search for script files, when
	loading, and using the first when saving. This means the first directory in the list
	is for work.
</p>

<p>
	Added global function codeDirs() which returns list of code dirs, if one wants to list
	content easily.
</p>
<pre>
	codeDirs->d d.files->f out(f)
</pre>



<h3>v1.0.10b 2020-07-04 Symbolic link</h3>
<p>
	Added symbolic link check on File (using nio). Created function .isSymlink() and added
	check preventing the following to operate when symlink: .delete() .create() .append() .move()
</p>


<h3>v1.0.10 2020-07-04 report() and Macro / block expressions</h3>
<p>
	Needed to clarify how report() works: each code block in a function or macro (logically) executes 
	in a single Ctx object. Each code block is (be definition) one loop space, and depending on whether
	there are looping statements there or not, will return either top-of-stack value, or list of elements 
	from calls to out(). Or report().
</p>
<p>
	Calls to report() are collected after the code block has executed, and are run through the Report
	tools, creating a list of strings, which are then added to the OutData, as if they were
	emitted via out(). Doing calls both to out() and to report() still means the lines from report()
	get added to the end of the OutData list.
</p>
<p>
	This same behaviour has now been implemented for ValueMacro, and verified.
</p>



<h3>v1.0.10 2020-07-04 PIPE in macro and block expression</h3>

<p>
	Renamed non-macro {} to "block expressions", as what is called ProgramLine in the code, and is
	the parts separated by PIPE '|', were called "code blocks" before {} was introduced.
</p>
<p>
	Enabled PIPE inside macros (and block expressions), tested ok
</p>
<p>
	Changed name from "plain text" to system messages in class OutText.
</p>
<p>
	Added function Lib.Sys.sysMsg(str) to test behaviour from macros etc
</p>




<h3>v1.0.9b 2020-07-03 Small fixes</h3>
<p>
	Removed FuncOverrides. It was always an abomination, and has never been needed.
</p>
<p>
	Deleted StmtCat - never used.
</p>



<h3>v1.0.9 2020-07-03 ObjFile encoding + small fixes</h3>
<p>
	Added backslash as valid "special" token. It was missing.
</p>
<p>
	Made Runtime.processInteractiveInput() more robust, in that if parsing fails completely,
	then reporting "next tokens" threw null-pointer-exception.
</p>
<p>
	Adding encoding attribute to ObjFile. (.encoding() and .setEncoding(Str)). Default is
	'ISO_8859_1'. Fixed and tested synthesis. Modifying functions .create .append .read .more,
	tested ok! Updated doc.
</p>


<h3>v1.0.8 2020-07-02 cd improvement</h3>
<p>
	Fixed processing of paths including File.separator, including absolute paths, and
	long relative paths, using the pre-existing tokenizer.
</p>
<p>
	Added Doc sections on "changing directory" and "listing files" at top of
	interactive use section.
</p>
<p>
	Improved Doc on generalized sorting etc.
</p>

<h3>v1.0.7b 2020-07-01 Removed some reporting</h3>
<p>
	Removed calls to outText.addPlainText() in ObjDir and ObjFile for situations that
	are what we expect. 
</p>
<p>
	println() can now be called without args for a simple newline
</p>
<p>
	Updated doc for code blocks, to follow section on conditionals
</p>
<p>
	Tiny modification to StmtIterate.execute() to execute single value iteration
	depending on value.getValAsBoolean() - was just considering boolean false, but 
	null is also boolean false (so is empty list, but that is correctly handled anyway).
</p>
<p>
	After the code parsing improvements, saving a script with "here"-documents from CFT
	replaced the "<<< EOF" notation with the generated List() code. Improved this by introducing
	modes to CodeLine objects: "NORMAL" is the default, and means the line was read from
	file, and is to be executed, as well as written back when saving. Then there's "ORIGINAL", which 
	means line was read from file and will be written to file, but not run, because it has been 
	replaced by one (or more) lines of type "GENERATED", which are run together with the "NORMAL"
	lines, but not saved.
</p>



<h3>v1.0.7 2020-06-30 Macro fixes</h3>
<p>
	Changed default macro into the "local" variant, only now it is known as "code-block", as it
	is resolved automatically. To make "independent" macros, the body must start with an
	asterisk '*' indicating it can run anywhere.
</p>

<pre>

(1) Changing defaults, so {} is now a local macro. The ExprMacro invokes
such a macro immediately, and returns the resulting value.

(2) The "independent" macro is now created as {* ... } where the star means
it can run anywhere. 

Updated Lib

(3) The local macro (or "code block") should run in a context that forwards 
lookups of parameters, but we must prevent outData.programContainsLooping() from
being global for the function. That means moving it into Ctx

(4) Moved it into Ctx, and added flag that stops propagation.

boolean programContainsLooping
boolean programContainsLoopingInfoStopsHere

Created method setProgramContainsLooping() and redirected calls from StmtLoop and StmtIterate.


Created Ctx.subContextForCodeBlock() which creates new sub-context same as sub() but
with separate OutData-object for collecting out(x). 


Seems to work.
</pre>

<h3>v1.0.6b 2020-06-29 Removed Net code</h3>
<p>
	Not in use, no clear idea of how it should work.
</p>
<p>
	Stored in CFT_Extra dir
</p>


<h3>v1.0.6 2020-06-29 Loops in macros</h3>
<p>
	Macros can now contain loops, but not the PIPE functionality.
</p>

<h3>v1.0.5 2020-06-27 ExternalScriptState - cached</h3>
<p>
	When calling function in external script, we want repeated calls to that same script to 
	reuse the same ObjGlobal. This is done by caching ExternalScriptState objects in
	ObjGlobal, allocated on a per-script basis.  
</p>
<pre>
	call "Lib:e" (savefile)
</pre>
<p>
	This means that the above code, which selects a favourite editor, and stores it in
	a ValDef, remembers this on the next call. Also, Input values and other data persisted
	to ObjGlobal are kept.
</p>
<p>
	Should an external script in turn call another external script, this gets cached internally
	in the same way, creating a tree of session states for external scripts.
</p>
<p>
	Updated doc on call expression and all over. Renamed macro mode from "global" to "independent".
</p>

<h2 style="color:blue">2020-06-27 project is "open source" on github</h3>



<h3>v1.0.4 2020-06-26 Modified if() expression</h3>
<p>
	The if() is modified so that when the selected expression resolves
	into a macro, it gets called automatically (once).
</p>


<h3>v1.0.4 2020-06-26 Added expression when()</h3>
<p>
	A simple implementation of multiple choice ("switch").
</p>
<pre>
	when (bool, expr)
</pre>
<p>
	When the first parameter is true, the expr is resolved. If it results in a macro (which is
	a value), then it is called automatically (once). If the boolean expression is false, 
	then the expression is never resolved, and instead null is returned.
</p>


<h3>v1.0.3b 2020-06-25 Fixed bug with CodeInlineDocument</h3>
<p>
	This was rewritten as part of file parsing 2020-06-21
</p>

<h3>v1.0.3 2020-06-24 Added global error() function</h3>
<p>
	Throws Exception, terminating code processing.
</p>


<h3>v1.0.2 2020-06-24 Added Lib.Sys</h3>
<p>
	The Sys object contains two functions: version() and functions()
</p>

<h3>v1.0.1 2020-06-23 cd improved</h3>
<p>
Changed so that if no direct match, cd uses one or more parts to match against 
available directories. This means one can enter one or more substrings of 
the target dir.
</p>

<h2 style="color:blue">2020-06-22 VERSION 1.0</h3>
<p>
	With the robustness added with regards to parsing script files and
	reporting errors, the versioning is changed from dates to numbers.
</p>

<p>
	Improved error reporting for interactive lines and defined functions when
	no script reload is done. Also fixed proper error reporting useing CodeLine.getSourceLocation()
	when Parser.parse() fails.
</p>



<h3>2020-06-21 SourceLocation improvement</h3>
<p>
	Using SourceLocation to report location in script file or
	"single line" just entered, or recently added but without script
	being reloaded (either manually or because of updates in editor).
	</p>
		

<h3>2020-06-21 File parsing / comments</h3>
<p>
	Fixed so that comments are processed correctly when executing code from file,
	by parsing the code as lines, instead of concatenating into a string which is
	then parsed.
	</p>
	
<p>
	Modified line editing command !x:marker!blabla to work only for 
	functions containing a single line of code
	</p>
	
<p>
	Also showing first non-blank line in function list '?', should perhaps contains
	a comment
	</p>
	
<h3>2020-06-14 Macro</h3>
<p>
	Created ExprMacro which is { Stmt* } and which when executed returns a
	ValueMacro object. This is a regular value, though not synthesizable, which
	can be stored in a variable or returned from a function,
</p>
<p>
	To call a macro, invoke the .call function on it, possibly with parameters,
	which are in turn picked up with the usual P() function.
</p>
<p>
	Macros come in two variants: local and global. A local macro has access
	to variables in the caller, and will redefine those when assigning, rather
	than create internal local variables. These macros
	are for internal use inside functions. This means that local variables inside
	the macro should be limited, as they have to be unique to avoid confusion.
</p>
<pre>
	{ &lt;- .... }
</pre>
<p>
	Global macros are scope-isolated macros that do not inherit anything from the caller 
	environment. They can be passed around as parameters, and called by anyone,
	without unfortunate side effects or errors due to missing symbols.
</p>
<pre>
	{ .... }           
</pre>
<p>
	Currently macros do not support loops or the PIPE character.
</p>
<h4>Example: automating data construction</h4>
<pre>
## Projects function
	{
		P(1)=name
		P(2)=path
		P(3)=types
	
		if(path.?trim, Dir(path), path) =path
		if(types.?trim, types.split, types) =types
	
		Dict.set("name",name).set("path",path).set("types",types)
	} =create
	#
	List(
		create.call("Project1", "xyz", "java"),
		create.call("Project2",  "c:\hub", "java txt")
	) 
/Projects
</pre>
<h4>Macros as parameters</h4>
<pre>
P(1,List)=options
P(2,{"name"})=macroGetElementName
	options-&gt;x
		println(macroGetElementName.call(x))
/ShowOptions

P(1,List)=options
P(2,{"name"})=macroGetElementName
	readLine("Enter part of name? ") =sel
	options-&gt;opt
		assert(macroGetElementName.call(opt).contains(sel))
		out(opt)
/SelectOptions
</pre>
<p>
	Here we see generic functions ShowOptions and SelectOptions, which are
	supplied a list of options, and a macro that is invoked on each
	item to produce a name.
</p>
<h4>Calling the above + extending if() expression</h4>
<pre>
Projects =p
	{
		" - " + P(1).get("name")
	} =macroGetElementName
	loop
		println("--------------------")
		println("Available projects")
		println("--------------------")

		ShowOptions (p, macroGetElementName)
		SelectOptions(p, macroGetElementName) =result
		false =breakOuter
		if (result.length==1, { 
			&lt;-
			ValDef("Project", result.nth)
			true =breakOuter
		}.call, 0)
		break(breakOuter)
		println("* Your selection gave " + result.length + " possible options")

/SelectProject
</pre>

<h3>2020-06-11 Added predicate calls: ".?"</h3>
<p>
	Instead of having to write predicate functions like String.isInt, there now
	is a modifier to dotted calls, and a new class DottedCall, invoked from ExprE.
</p>
<pre>
	"sdf".?parseInt
	&lt;boolean&gt;
  	false
</pre>
<p>
	This notation returns error string if there is an exception, otherwise boolean true. 
</p>
<p>
  The predicate calls can also be used to check if a function exists for a value, and
  in this way identify the type of a value, using identity functions, String.isString(), 
  List.isList() and so on. <b>TODO?</b>
</p>



<h3>2020-06-10 Added :NN</h3>
<p>
	Often one wants to access the n'th element of a result list, and ls(N) was created
	for this. Now created colon command, which checks if last result is a List, and then
	synthesizes the indicated element.
</p>
<pre>
	$ ls
	$ :0
</pre>

<h3>2020-06-09 Added Dir.runCapture() </h3>
<p>
	Created Dir.runCapture() which is a copy of Dir.run(), except that it captures output
	and returns a list with the output lines.
</p>
<p>
	The output lines are also sent to the screen, in case the external command asks the user
	for input. Curses-based programs like nano and top are not suited for .runCapture()
</p>

<pre>
	Dir.runCapture("ls")
</pre>

<h3>2020-06-09 Added List.empty() function</h3>

<h3>2020-06-09 Added Global.FileLine() function</h3>
<p>
	This enables full synthesize-functionality of FileLine, rather than inheriting the
	String class version, which is incomplete. Added and tested ValueObjFileLine synthesize()
	method.
</p>

<h3>2020-06-09 Added Version info</h3>
<p>
	Created Version.java class, displayed from Main
</p>

<h3>2020-06-09 fixed bug in String synthesize</h3>
<p>
	Force escaping when string contains newline, cr or tab
</p>

<h3>2020-06-08 P() default value fix</h3>
<p>
	Originally, the default value was only used if the number of parameters given was
	too short. Changed this so that giving null as positional parameter, means using
	the default, if any.
</p>

<h3>2020-06-08 PDict() expression</h3>
<p>
	Added PDict() under ExprTerminal. It takes a comma-separated list of strings, which are mapped to
	the function parameters by position, and returns a Dict object. If more names than
	actual parameters, the value null is stored in the Dict.
</p>
<p>
	The point is to simplify functions performing merging, which uses a dictionary. 
	Also changed the String.merge() function to replace value null with "" (and not just
	blindly getValAsString()).
</p>


<h3>2020-06-08 String.hash</h3>
<p>
	Added hash() function to string.
</p>

<h3>2020-06-08 File.hex \r\n\t</h3>
<p>
	Added detection for CR, LF and TAB, and displaying \r\n\t for those.
</p>

<h3>2020-06-07 negative index to List.nth</h3>
<p>
List.nth(-1) returns last element, .nth(-2) second last and so on
</p>

<h3>2020-06-07 File.hex</h3>
<p>
Renamed from File.hexList, made interactive, fixed bug (omitting display of characters with ascii 127), and
added position col
</p>

<h3>2020-06-07 CharTable</h3>
<p>
Code is used in MVRS, and fails for long strings due to stack overflow. Fixed and tested.
</p>

<h3>2020-06-07 println</h3>
<p>
Global function println
</p>


<h3>2020-06-05 assert/reject in loop</h3>
<p>
Code for checking for assert/reject logic was added for "loop" statement. 
</p>

<h3>2020-06-03 Command line arguments</h3>
<p>
	Renamed the ConfigTool start script to ./cft, and it now supports command line parameters.
	The first is the name of the script file, then follows zero or more strings that are
	executed as if they were regular input.
</p>

<h3>2020-05-24 New master Doc.html</h3>
<p>
The Overview.txt contains disposition of topics
</p>

<h3>2020-03-15 Net routing</h3>
<p>
Routing ok
</p>

<h3>2020-03-08 Net v2</h3>
<p>
Network module v2. Crypto ok. Ping ok.
</p>


<h3>2020-03-06 readLine(prompt)</h3>
<p>
	Reads single text line without any "remembering" previous values as Input does
</p>


<h3>2020-02-28 Stdio</h3>
<p>
	Internal change: created Stdio to replace presence of stdin, stdout and the buffer class
	for input text lines (programmed via stdin("xxx"))
</p>



<h3>2020-02-22 'here' documents</h3>
<p>
	Added notation for converting block of text in savefile to list of strings. 
</p>

<pre>
	&lt;&lt;&lt; marker
	line 1
	line 2
	&gt;&gt;&gt; marker
</pre>

<p>
	This is a source-file feature, not available in the interactive shell, which instead
	offers the function readLines(endMarker)
</p>

<h3>2019-12-20 Float()</h3>
<p>
	Following the template of Int() and Str(), for sorting floating point values
</p>

<h3>2019-11-07 File.readBytes()</h3>
<p>
	Added function readBytes on File object. Great for producing wave diagrams for sound
	recordings (signed).
</p>

<h3>2019-10-30 automatic refresh when savefile changed</h3>
<p>
	Editing files with editors, we now get immediate update
	when the save file is changed on disk.
</p>

<p>
	Keeping the ":load" without file name, though it is redundant.
</p>

<h3>2019-10-20 savefile</h3>
<p>
	Created global function savefile() which returns File object for current savefile.
</p>
<pre>
Dir.runDetach("leafpad",savefile.path)
</pre>


<h3>2019-10-19 List.push()</h3>
<p>
	Created "stack push" function for List, taking the following parameters:
</p>

<pre>
List.push(Count,Default?)
</pre>

<p>
	The Count is the number of elements we want pushed on the stack, and the Default is the
	value to use if list does not contain enough elements. The values can then be assigned
	to local variables in natural order.
</p>

<pre>
$ "x y".split.push(3,"*")=a=b=c a+":"+b+":"+c
  &lt;String&gt;
  x:y:* 
</pre>


<h3>2019-10-19 Dict properties as functions</h3>
<p>
	Setting properties with names that are identifies, that don't collide with existing
	functions, are added as dynamically generated functions, accessible via dotted notation.
</p>

<p>
	Dict.set("a",5)
	/x
	x.a  # gives 5
</p>

<h3>2019-10-18 Cfg.wrap() and :wrap</h3>
<p>
	Added wrap state to Cfg, settable via Cfg.wrap(boolean) and flippable via colon command ":wrap"
</p>

<h3>2019-10-18 Dir.showTree() function</h3>
<p>
	Added Dir.showTree(Dir, LimitKb?) which returns a list of lines with all directories
	under Dir, which contain files, and the sum of sizes of files in those directories is &gt;= LimitKb (defaults to 0). 
</p>

<p>
	Or one can use code
</p>

<pre>
+-----------------------------------------------------
| DFiles  : P(1,Dir)=d 0=n d.files-&gt;f f.length+n=n | n/1024=x ""+x+" kb"
| ShowTree: P(1,Dir).allDirs-&gt;d report(d.path, DFiles(d)) | _.sort
+-----------------------------------------------------
| .       : ShowTree
+-----------------------------------------------------
</pre>

<h3>2019-10-18 isWindows() function</h3>
<p>
	Returns boolean
</p>

<h3>2019-10-17 File.hexList</h3>
<p>
	Create File.hexList() which returns a list of strings displaying the
	content in hex for any file.
</p>


<h3>2019-10-17 cat</h3>
<p>
	Created statement "cat" which follows the format of "cd", in that it either
	takes (Expr) or eats the rest of the line, concatenates it and ends up with
	a file path, which is then dumped directly to output, line by line, no formatting.
</p>

<p>
	When successful, the cat statement puts the file as an ObjFile value on the
	stack.
</p>


<h3>2019-10-17 todo.txt</h3>
<p>
	Due to using text editors for modifying save files, there is no longer much point in
	creating advanced line editing functions. Even on a CLI one can always invoke "nano"
	or similar.
</p>

<p>
	Also, due to Dir.runDetach, the use of editors also reduce the need for 
	advanced File.more, as it is easier to search and page around in an editor. 
</p>


<h3>2019-10-16 Cfg.w / .getScreenWidth / Grep.file()</h3>
<p>
	Lines from files, must have TAB substituted with spaces. Using existing code
	written for File.more, moved it to rf.configtool.util.TabUtil, and
	now integrated it into Grep, for cleaner result lists still.
</p>
<p>
	Also added the same conversion on File.read, converting tabs to spaces, as 
	file reading is primarily about displaying data. Note that DataFile is not
	modified, as it is used to produce output files, and no conversion of tabs
	should take place there.
</p>

<h3>2019-10-15 Cfg.w / .getScreenWidth / displaying result</h3>
<p>
	Added code to respect this (Runtime.processInteractiveInput()), after making
	Report class return list of strings, rather than writing to stdout itself. 
</p>


<h3>2019-10-15 call() finalized</h3>
<p>
	The call statement is now the call expression, and its syntax is extended:
</p>

<pre>
	call "savefile:function" [ with(Dict) ] Params?
</pre>

<p>
	And it all works, and is a way to reuse code while overriding functions with values, 
	as long as those values can be synthesized into strings.
</p>

<pre>
+-----------------------------------------------------
| a   : 5
| b   : "hei"+a
| d   : Dict.set("a","xxx")
| test: call "test:b" with (d)
+-----------------------------------------------------
| .   : test
+-----------------------------------------------------
Current save name: test
$ test
  &lt;String&gt;
  heixxx 
$
</pre>

<p>
	The same mechanism will be handy when invoking from the command line, wrapping each
	value into ValueString, then synthesizing, to ensure valid code. 
</p>

<p>
	Implementation details:  rf.configtool.main.CallScriptFunc is the gateway.
</p>




<h3>2019-10-13 list becomes List</h3>
<p>
	The list function is renamed to List.
</p>

<p>
	To identify needed changes:
</p>
<pre>
$ Dir.files(Glob("savefile*"))-&gt;f Grep("list").file(f) -&gt;line out(line)
</pre>


<h3>2019-10-12 cd / ls</h3>
<p>
	As cd is used interactively, it was easy to fix it, just scanning the rest
	of the input, and concatenating a path string. Also eliminated the name "dir",
	and added two more names, so that
</p>

<ol>
	<li>"ls" - list of directories and files</li>
	<li>"lsf" - list of files</li>
	<li>"lsd" - list of directories</li>
</ol>


<h3>2019-10-06 savefile format</h3>
<p>
	Created v2 savefile format, which is readable and editable. It is identified
	by first line of file being #v2. Also modified '?' command to display code in
	the same order as in the save file. Multi-line code is supported on read, and 
	is preserved when saved, except for functions that have been changed. 
</p>

<p>
	But even for modified functions, we preserve original lines preceding the function,
	if such exist.
</p>

<p>
	Also modified updates so that the original order is maintained.
</p>

<p>
	And finally modified the ":load" command so that identifier is optional, except
	for the very first time, as reload after modifications to save file will now
	be required.
</p>

<h3>2019-10-01 debug</h3>
<p>
	Added statement debug(expr), to display text directly.
</p>

<h3>2019-10-01 loop / break</h3>
<p>
	Created loop statement, which loops forever, until break(true) is invoked. Note that
	break can also be applied when iterating over a list value with "expr-&gt;..."
</p>

<p>
	Created in anticipation of FileReader, which reads single lines from files, for 
	filtering huge log files.
</p>

<h3>2019-09-26 changed local variable scope rules</h3>
<p>
	Introduced java class FunctionState, which contains both function parameters, and
	all variables assigned via "=x". This allows for more logical constructs such as
	</p>

<pre>
	$ 0=sum list(1,2,3)->x sum+x =sum | sum   # <-- returns 6
</pre>

<h3>2019-09-15 global Cfg object</h3>
<p>
	Created Cfg object, available via global function by same name. It currently contains the 
	following variables:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>'h' - height of screen - default 24</li>
	<li>'w' - width of screen - default 130</li>
	<li>'wd' - wrap data output - default true</li>
	<li>'wm' - wrap more lines - default false</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h4>Currently implemented</h4>
<ul>
	<li>the '?' command - respects 'w'</li>
	<li>the showCode() function - respects 'w'</li>
</ul>
</p>


<h3>2019-09-15 list.insert</h3>
<p>
	Added function insert(pos,val) on list, doing destructive modification on self().
</p>

<h3>2019-09-14 list.set</h3>
<p>
	Added function set(pos,val) on list, doing a destructinve modification on self()
</p>

<h3>2019-09-15 list.remove</h3>
<p>
	Added function remove(pos) on list, doing a destructive change on self(), constituting
	the opposite of add() which also modifies the instance itself (and which is important when
	using Val() to repeatedly refer to same object).
</p>

<h3>Manual entry - example</h3>
<p>
	Using readLines to paste in for example a netplan file, followed by a ":syn" to create an
	actual list value. Then use replace to replace for instance an IP address with a merge
	code.
</p>

<h3>2019-09-14 list.replace</h3>
<p>
	Added function replace(str1,str2) for the list value object. It traverses the list
	and reads each value as string, then replaces str1 with str2. Returns new list.
</p>

<h3>2019-09-14 readLines</h3>
<p>
	Added global function readLines(endmarker) which reads input lines until label found on separate line.
	Returns a list, which must be synthesized (with :syn) to be useful. Nice for creating a list
	of strings from a text file that is copy-pasted into the window, followed by manually
	entering the endmarker.
</p>
<p>
	2019-10-17 renamed from original name "cat", as "cat" is now used to list a file.
</p>



<h3>2019-09-04 Dir.run()</h3>

<p>
	Run external commands. Uses redirecting of stdin, stdout and stderr. This means
	we get to interact with external programs, but not buffer input via the stdin()
	mechanism. For that we must probably implement some threads.
</p>

<pre>
	$ Dir.run("ls")
	$ Dir.run("ls","-l")
	$ list("ls","-l")
	$ /cmd
	$ Dir.run(cmd)
</pre>

<h3>2009-09-04 File.move()</h3>
<p>
	Implemented .move(File) to rename and/or move a file. Returns self or throws
	Exception. 
</p>

<h3>2009-09-04 Dict.setStr() and .mergeCodes()</h3>

<p>
	Added setStr() function to Dict, which parses string on format "xxx : yyy" or "xxx = yyy", and
	puts value "yyy" in dictionary under key "xxx" (both trimmed).
</p>

<p>
	Also added function mergeCodes() that returns copy where all keys are modified into ${key},
	for use as merge codes.
</p>

<h3>2019-09-04 DataFile upgrades</h3>

<p>
	DataFile supports comment lines to be excluded.
</p>

<pre>
	$ DateFile(File("x.txt"),"###").comment(";")
	$ /df
</pre>

<h3>2019-09-02 Dict.get default value</h3>

<p>
	Added optional default value for Dict.get(name), so that when no value is found for name,
	the default value is added to the dictionary, under the given name, and then returned.
</p>

<p>
	This enables compact code:
</p>

<pre>
	$ P(1,Dict)=d d.get("lines",list).add("hello")
</pre>

<h3>2019-09-02 Session Values</h3>

<p>
	Created two global functions, for maintaining session values. These let us instantiate
	a Dict or list object that does not go away until explicitly reset, which can be
	referred via simple code:
</p>

<pre>
	$ ValDef("x",list)
	$ /Init

	$ Val("x")
	$ /x

	$ x.add(1)
	$ x.add(2)
	$ x.sum
	  3
</pre>

<p>
	Persistent values can are cleared by redefining them to null, which is the default
	value when trying to get a value that doesn't exist.
</p>

<pre>
	$ ValDef("x",list)
</pre>


<h3>2019-09-02 String .esc and .unEsc</h3>
<p>
	Needed a more robust synthesize method for strings, so added two functions to String, which
	escapes all dangerous characters (even including space) and the reverse function. 
</p>

<p>
	Changed the synthesize method of ValueString, so that when string contains both types of quotes,
	it returns the escaped string in regular quotes, followed by .unEsc, thus generating code 
	that restores the actual string.
</p>


<h3>2019-06-28 Input history</h3>

<p>
	Added history over the last 100 entered values, accessed via
</p>

<pre>
	:       -- list numbered options
	:N      -- use numbered option

<h3>2019-06-25 Remote Server and Client</h3>
<p>
	Created a remote server that listens to a port, and a remote client that
	connects to a remote server on an address and port. Currently no 
	gentle way of leaving the connection, but apart from that it works
</p>

<pre>
	Net.RemoteServer(2500).init

	Net.RemoteClient("localhost",2500).connect

	[localhost] $
</pre>

<p>
	TODO
</p>

<ol>
	<li>put connection into the background, where it receives output and buffers it
	internally, to be displayed later when put into foreground</li>
	<li>Need a way of regaining control of the local process, f.ex via command ":local"</li>
	<li>Must also have a way of displaying connections, closing connections and activating background connection</li>
	<li>Running connections in the background gives us a multitasking ability with, when
		connecting localhost and running code there
	</li>
</ol>

<h3>2019-06-18 uncompress compressed files</h3>
<p>
	Added File.uncompress(targetDir). Using old FileInfo class. It is not sophisticated, but it
	solved a problem. Copies uncompressed files unchanged
</p>

<h3>2019-05-31 Lib.Net</h3>
<p><b>2019-06-25: moved to GlobalObj</b></p>
<p>
	Want to use ConfigTool to push data over networks, possibly extending to full
	remote control. Added the following functions, which allows us to set up a server
	listening on a TCP server port, and using a client to push files over the network
	to such servers. 
</p>

<pre>
	Net.PushServer(2500).init    # sets up tcp server on port 2500

	Net.PushClient("127.0.0.1",2500)  # creates client
	/c

	c.push(File)
	c.push(File,"targetName")
	c.remoteDir("xxx")
</pre>

<h3>2019-05-30 Grep takes regex</h3>

<p>
	Added two functions to Grep: matchRegex(re) and rejectRegex(re)
</p>

<h3>2019-05-30 String matching</h3>
<p>
	Added functions for locating substrings
</p>

<pre>
	"abcd".before("c")
	"ab"

	"abcd".after("b")
	"cd"

	"abcd".between("a","d")
	"bc"

	"abbb".beforeLast("b")
	"abb"

	"aaab".afterLast("a")
	"b"
</pre>

<h3>2019-04-04 Regex handling</h3>
<p>
	Created class Regex under runtime.lib, with a single static method for building RegEx from strings. Using
	this method from <i>ObjGlob</i>.
</p>
<p>
	Also modified inner workings of old class <i>ObjFilter</i> to build internal list of RE's, using Regex class. This allows
	for more sophisticated filtering, as multiple contains("xxx") operate with logical AND between them, 
	plus that Filter has support for case sensitive on/off. Added method for adding RE directly.
</p>

<p>
	<i>TODO: upgrade ObjGrep to use RE's internally?</i>
</p>

<h3>2019-03-22 syn() function</h3>
<p>
	In preparation for creating multiline scripts, as well as for general flexibility, I've added
	the global syn() function, which takes a synthesizable value, and returns as a string the code
	that creates it. If the value can not be synthesized, an error is reported.
</p>

<p>
	Also added String.indexOf() function for improved parsing.
</p>


<h3>2019-02-17 Function.java </h3>

<p>
	(2019-03-13 updated)
</p>

<p>
	As part of creating a Gui class which should contain interactivity, we needed to extend the callFunction()
	of the Function class, as invoked from LookupOrCall.resolve(). Created a parallel method, called callFunctionNew(), 
	which by default calls the callFunction() method, which is now defined in Function.java throwing exception.
</p>

<p>
	The callFunctionNew() takes Ctx object instead of TextIn and TextOut, which are anyway direct properties of the
	Ctx object. 
</p>

<p>
	Also extended the CommandProcessor interface to include the method processProgramLine.
</p>

<p>
	In sum this makes it possible to create code that executes code. The first example is the Gui.button("name","code"), which
	when having its "clicked" function called, executes the "code", using the CommandProcessor.processProgramLine() method. This
	method returns a value, which becomes the return value from the clicked() method. This of course exemplifies how an
	eval("str") function should work.
</p>

<p>
	So obviously eval(str) was the next to be created.
</p>

<p>
	2019-03-17 Never got the GUI to work, so deleted it.
</p>

<h3>2019-02-17 ObjPersistent</h3>
<p>
	After creating Gui.show, which displays a graphical interface, a method for killing that window on exit was needed. 
</p>
<p>
	This was done by extending
	the ObjPersistent class with a method cleanupOnExit(), which for ObjGui performs a dispose on the App object. Also added identically named method to ObjGlobal, and a call to that from Main on exit.
</p>
<p>
	Also added method initPersistentObj() which is called once for each persisted instance. Added this method to the Gui object (ObjGui),
	as a way of popping up the JFrame after it has been created and recognized as the first Gui object. Later calls to Gui which returns
	objects with persistence-id matching an existing object are thrown away, and replaced by the persisted object.
</p>


<h3>2019-03-13 showCode()</h3>
<p>
	Added wildcard '*' option at end of name matches.
</p>

<p>
	Example: showCode("DirCurr,Dir*:Config|S*:Search|*:The rest")
</p>

<p>
	The point of DirCurr before Dir* is to ensure DirCurr is displayed before other Dir* whatever their alphabetical order.
</p>

2018-09-15 DONE
---------------
- Fix problem with int+-*/float
- Added round() function to ValueFloat

2018-09-09 DONE
---------------
- Change list.add to modify same instance, instead
of creating new. This means we can add data to an
instance referred via local variable.

- 'help' displays functions inside object in alphabetical
order.

2018-09-08 DONE
---------------
- Allow multiple programlines to be added on a single
line, separated by the pipe symbol, and using the "_"
underscore value for the return value of the 
previous programline:

Dir(".").files->f out(Int(f.length,f)) | _.sort.reverse->x out(x.data)


2018-08-27 DONE
---------------
- Supporting parameters to named lines:

P(pos,val) returns parameter value at pos (1-based) if called, otherwise val.

Ex. 

P(1,"x")=s s+"y"
-> returns xy when declared
/F

F("a")
-> returns "ay"
