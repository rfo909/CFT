TODO
----

- Make terminal program configurable (@cmd)

- Make file manager program configurable (@fm)

- better terminal I/O handling, like not losing control over the UI if
  running a command like "top" in the background ...
  
- make embeddable version that strips away the shell-like commands and 
  interactive stuff, in order to embed string, int, file, float, dir, etc
  functionality into other environments
