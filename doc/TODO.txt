TODO
----

- Make terminal program configurable (@cmd)

- Make file manager program configurable (@fm)

- Create support for additional configuration file that modifies and adds to the
  default CFT.props, and which is not checked in, to avoid overwriting local 
  settings on git pull



- better terminal I/O handling, like not losing control over the UI if
  running a command like "top" in the background ...
