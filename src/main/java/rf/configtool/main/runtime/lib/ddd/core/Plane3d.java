/**
* This class identifies a 3d plane, defined by three points.
* It contains methods to solve the plane equation for particular points in space,
* so that one can decide if single points are inside or outside the plane. What is inside
* and outside is defined by the order of the three points in the constructor: seen from
* the outside, points should always be given in anti-clockwise order. In a right-handed
* coordinate system. Which is what we use, anyway.
* <P>
* An other important method that will be
* used a lot by surface viewers is the method to find the point in 3d-space where a ray
* from the center of the coordinate system (eye) intersects with the plane.
