 * Code lines initially are just the combination of a source location plus a line, but as

 * the original lines and the generated lines. 
 * 
 * When parsing for execution, it is the "normal" lines plus the "generated" lines that are used. See CodeLines.getTokenStream().
 * However, when writing original code to the save file, we use "normal" and "original" lines, and ignore "generated". See CodeLines.getSaveFormat()
 * 
 * A "normal" line is one that is read from file and parsed.
